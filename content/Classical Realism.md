# Classical Realism

Is a branch of [[Realism\|Realism]] that emphasizes the study of human and states behaviors

## Characteristics [^1]

- Human Nature: Virtually everyone is born with a will to power hardwired into them, which effectively means that great powers are led by individuals who are bent on having their state dominate its rivals [^2]
    - Nothing can be done to alter that drive to be all-powerful.
- **States:**
    - only care about survival of themselves
    - morals and ethics doesn't limit states' behavior
    - selfish and competitive with other states
    - Need power to defend one-self
        - the best defense is an offense: to not let others get more powerful

## **Assumptions [^1]**

- International Politics is an arena for states to exercise their political power for national interests
- International Politics is about **survival** through different methods:
    - **Adapt to Survive**: If a rising power is rising, another dominant power will try to resist them from rising. Leading to the trap of war between two major powers. [[Thucydides\|Thucydides]]
    - **Aware and Anticipate**: actions of other states to defend and preemptive attack potential enemies. [[Niccolò Machiavelli\|Niccolò Machiavelli]]
    - **Every State for Themselves**: states build compete in building up security making everyone less secure in the [[Security Dilemma\|Security Dilemma]]. [[Thomas Hobbes\|Thomas Hobbes]]
    - **Mindful Statecraft for Welfare**: keeping in mind flaws of human nature to decide what is best security and welfare for people. IR isn't conducted with morals, its unpredictable. [[Hans Morgenthau\|Hans Morgenthau]]
