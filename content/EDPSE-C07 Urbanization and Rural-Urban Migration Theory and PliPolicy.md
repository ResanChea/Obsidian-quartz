# EDPSE-C07 Urbanization and Rural-Urban Migration Theory and Policy

- The Migration and Urbanization Dilemma: the debate of whether developed or developing countries are more urbanized.

- More population growth -> more urbanization

- **[Agglomeration economies](https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c7977/c7977.pdf)** are the benefits that come when firms and people locate near one another together in cities and industrial clusters. 
	- Localization (industry or sector) economies??
	- Workers benefits
		- saving on transportation
		- firm workplace is near
	- Firms benefits 
		- saving on transportation
		- skilled workers are near
		- specialized infrastructure
		- potential spillover of knowledge/tech from related industries
	- [Industrial districts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_district): Industrial district is a place where workers and firms, specialized in a main industry and auxiliary industries, live and work. or *Clusters*
		- Makes the industry sector more efficient. 
		- Developing countries make little progress

## Conditions in urbanized cities

- Congestion cost: always busy traffic cost time and money
	- Industrial districts for productivity also lowers congestion cost.
- Different industrial specialization means different size cities
- Need of extensive infrastructure in the capital
- Smaller cities may be expected in labor-intensive developing countries
	- ==Why?==

## Problems with urbanization

- Urban Gigantism: when the *First-City Bias* makes people, firms, and investment concentrate in the first and biggest already existing city due to it already having the necessary infrastructure.
- Causes of Urban Gigantism:
	- Avoid cost of importing/transporting anything by putting every industry in one city
	- ==“Bread and circuses” to prevent unrest==
	- ==Hub and spoke transportation system (rather than web) makes transport costs high for small cities==
	- ==Compounding effect of locating the national capital in the largest city==
		- Makes the problem worse
- More slums and poorer living conditions

## Urban Informal Sector

- Jobs, economic activities, that aren't protected or covered by law
	- Coffee shop employment
	- Supermarkets
	- Sometimes employ more than formal sector

- Why urbanization is speeding up?
	- There are less obstacles or drawbacks of migrating to cities
		- Communication technology
	- Less cost of transportation
		- Closer consumer goods, services (education, fire, police), and workplace.

- $W_A=\frac{L_M}{L_{UC}}(\overline{W}_M)$
	- $L_A$ = Labor force in agriculture
	- $L_{UC}$ = Labor force in urbanized city (manufacturing)
	- $W_M$ = Medium wage
