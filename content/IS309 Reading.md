Simulation modeling 2 forms - highly empirical, generate real-world scenarios - highly abstract, focus on using models to explore logic of social processes

Pepinsky critique simulated models as reducing assumptions about international politics to rules and parameters that can be changed. Inaccurate to the real thing.

- ABM computer simulated models inductively predict reaction of actors in an environment.
    - Quanitative: uses mathematical models
    - Qualitative: generate data to analyze inductively

Ability to alter rules and parameters can cause bias to seek result you want instead Creating Agent Based Model - using computer software with - a set of characteristics - ability to interpret environment - a decision making process - Set in social environment - analyzed deductively or inductively
