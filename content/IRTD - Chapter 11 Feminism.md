- Feminist theories of IR use gender as a socially constructed category of analysis when they analyze foreign policy, international political economy, and international security.
- Feminist security research takes two major forms: theoretical reformulation and empirical evaluation.

# 1. Introduction

- Feminist theories entered the discipline of IR in the late 1980s and early 1990s (often referred to as third debate or fourth debate)

### Early IR Feminists

- Early IR feminists: how its theories might be reformulated and how its understanding of global politics might be improved if attention were paid to women's experiences.
- Feminists claimed that the differential impact of the state system and the global economy on the lives of women and men could be fully understood only when introducing gender analysis
- IR feminists critically re-examined some of the key concepts such as sovereignty, the state, and security.
- IR feminists have also sought to draw attention to women's invisibility and gender subordination in international politics and the global economy.

### Second generation IR feminist

- Second generation IR feminist: feminist have sought to demonstrate how vital women are to states' foreign policies and to the functioning of the global economy.  Women's lives offer us a perspective outside the state-centric focus

### Feminists' definition of gender

- Feminists define gender as a set of socially constructed characteristics describing what men and women ought to be.
    - Masculinity: strength, rationality, independence, protector, and public. These aka hegemonic masculine characteristics.
    - Femininity: weakness, emotionality, rational, protected, and private
- Men, women, and the states they live in generally assign more positive value to masculine characteristics than to feminine ones.
- These gender dualism also organize and divide social activities between groups of humans
    
    Example:
    
    - Women associate with private sphere → caregivers
    - Men associate with public space → natural breadwinners

# 2. Gender in IR

### Third debate in the [[The Four Great Debates in IR\|The Four Great Debates in IR]]

- The third debate: scholars began to question the epistemological and ontological foundations of a field (positivist, rationalist, and materialist theories)
    
    Example: 
    
    - Postpositivist scholarship questions positivist's beliefs
    - Postpositivist rejects rationalist methodologies and causal explanation
- Postpositivist advocate more interpretive, ideational, and sociological methods for understanding global politics
- Many feminist share this postpositivist commitment to examine the relationship between knowledge and power
    - Feminist point out that most knowledge has been created by men and is about men

### Conventional IR vs IR feminist

- Conventional IR relies on generalized rationalist explanation of asocial states' behavior in an anarchic international system
- IR feminist theories focus on social relations (gender relations). Rather than anarchy, they see an international system constituted by socially constructed gender hierarchies
    - In order to reveal gender hierarchies, feminists 
    often begin their examinations of international relations at the micro-level-how lives of individual affect and are affected by global politics

### IR Feminist Research

- IR feminist research can be divided into two complementary but distinct generations:
    - First generation: focused on theory formulation
        - bringing to light and critiquing the gendered foundations of IR theories and of the practice of international politics
    - Second generation: approached empirical situation with gendered lenses
        - begun to develop their own research programs
        - use gender as a category of analysis

# 3. Typology of IR Feminist theories

Many of these feminist theories build on, but go beyond some of the IR perspective such as liberalism, constructivism, critical theory, poststructuralism and post colonialism. 

### Liberal feminism - [[Liberalism\|Liberalism]]

Liberal feminism calls attention to the subordinate position of women in global politics but remains committed to investigating the causes of this within a positivist framework. 

- **Assumptions:** Liberal feminists believe that women’s equality can be achieved by removing legal and other obstacles that have denied them the same rights and opportunities as men.
- **Methodological preferences:** Liberal feminists use gender as an explanatory variable in foreign-policy analysis
- **Exemplary writings:** Mary Caprioli and Mark Boyer use statistical indicator to investigate whether there is a relationship between domestic gender equality and states' use of violence internationally
    - Result: Violence decrease as domestic gender equality increase
    - Critique from postpositivist: There is problem with measuring gender inequality using statistical indicators, must go deeper than this.

### Critical feminism - [[Critical Theory\|Critical Theory]]

- **Assumptions:** Ideas are the product of human agents. Therefore, there is possibility of change. Critical theory is committed to understanding the world in order to try to change it.
- **Methodological preferences:** Goes beyond liberal feminism's use of gender as a variable. It explores the ideational and material manifestations of gendered identities and gendered power in global politics
- **Exemplary writings:**
    - Sandra Whitworth: *Feminism and International Relations* - Examines he different ways gender was understood over time
    - Christine Chin's: *In Service and Servitude* - examines the increasing prevalence of underpaid and often exploited foreign female domestic workers in Malaysia during 1970

### Feminist constructivism - [[Constructivism\|Constructivism]]

- **Assumptions:**  Ideas about gender shape and are shaped by global politics
- **Methodological preferences:** ideas about womanhood and femininity
- **Exemplary writings:**
    - Elisabeth Prugl: *The Global Construction of Gender* - analyze the treatment of homebased work in international negotiation and international law.

### Feminist poststructuralism - [[Post-Structuralism\|Post-Structuralism]]

- **Assumptions:  Poststructuralist feminism** is particularly concerned with the way dichotomized linguistic 
constructions, such as strong/weak, rational/emotional, and public/private, serve to empower 
the masculine over the feminine. They believed that these distinctions have real world consequences
- **Methodological preferences:** Feminist poststructuralists seek to expose and deconstruct these hierarchies—often 
through the analysis of texts and their meaning.
- **Exemplary writings:**
    - Charlotte Hooper: *Manly States* - what role does international relations theory and practice 
    play in shaping, defining, and legitimating masculinities
    - Laura Shepherd: *Gender, Violence, and Security*

### Postcolonial feminism - [[Post-Colonialism\|Post-Colonialism]]

- **Assumptions:**  Postcolonial feminists see false claims of universalism arising 
from knowledge which is based largely on the experiences of relatively privileged Western women.
- **Methodological preferences:** Culture, social class, race and geographical location
- **Exemplary writings:**
    - Chandra Mohanty: criticize some Western feminists for treating women as a homogeneous category
    - Lily Ling and Annathangelou: seek to redress these subordinations within their own cultural context, rather than through some universal understanding of women’s needs
