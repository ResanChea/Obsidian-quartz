# Intra-State Inequality

- Intra-state inequality has been going up. Income gap in each groups of society is getting bigger.
- wage dispersion can fall at the same time as income dispersion between workers rises if there is higher unemployment and a reduction in working hours
- Why?
    - Strong Technological Development in developed countries
    - strong regional growth of some major developing countries
        - China and India: growth unevenly between coastal manufacturing regions vs inalnd rural areas
    - Collapse of communism & difficult transition to democracy
    - Demographic trends
    - Unequal development in education
    - Opening-up economies tend to increase inequality in developed countries with a higher proportion of skilled workers
