# Chapter 5: Logical Fallacies

# I. Logical Fallacy

Fallacious Arguments are arguments which contain one more more *[[Logical Fallacy\|Logical Fallacy]]*.

Logical Fallacy (fallacy): arguments which contains mistakes in reasoning.

Divided into two:

- Fallacies of relevance premises logically unrelated/irrelevant to conclusion
- Fallacies of insufficient evidence: premises related but provide insufficient evidence to prove the conclusion

# II. The Concept of Relevance


ðŸ’¡ A statement is relevant if it counts either for or against that other statement



Applies for both Deductive and Inductive

## Positively Relevant

if the statement counts in favor of another statement

- Even making the conclusion slightly more probable than before is *positively relevant*

**Concepts:**

- Factually false statements can also be *positively relevant*
- statements are *positively relevant* when the context relates it to one another
    - Contextual statement could turn two NR statements to a PR statement
        
        Martina partied all night last night. However, Martina was valedictorian of her
        high school class. Therefore, she will do well on her critical thinking test this
        morning.
        

## Negatively Relevant

if the statement counts against another statement

- If the premise is true the conclusion is more likely to be false

## Logical Irrelevance

- if the statement neither count for nor against another statement
- The premise doesn't related to the conclusion in any way

# III. Fallacies of Relevance


ðŸ’¡ Argument with Premises that are irrelevant to the conclusion



## 1. Personal Attack (Ad Hominem)

Reject someone claim or argument and attacking the person rather than their argument or reasoning

- A person's character does not reflect their argument's strength

**(Exception)**

- A personal characteristic that is relevant to the conclusion is not fallacious however
    
    If a person's character helps to prove the point it is a good argument
    

## 2. Attacking the Motive

Criticizing a person's motivation for offering the argument rather than examining the argument's strength itself.

- Even if a person is not in position to raise that argument, the argument still needs to be evaluated for its reasoning, not it's arguer's motive.

**Common Pattern:**

1. X is biased or has questionable motives.
2. Therefore, Xâ€™s argument or claim should be rejected.

**(Exception)**

If the arguer has obvious bias that has reflected obvious lies in their argument. It's not the critique to the argument but to the motive of the arguer.

## 3. Look Who's Talking

Reject someone claim or argument as they are a hypocrite who doesn't practice what they preach

- Reasons need to be examined rather than invalidating an argument based on the arguer

**Common Pattern:**

1. X fails to follow his or her own advice.
2. Therefore, Xâ€™s claim or argument should be rejected.

**(Exception)**

Pointing out someone is a hypocrite and accepting the behavior is wrong is not a fallacy

## 4. Two Wrongs Make a Right

Arguer attempts to justify a wrongful act by claiming some other acts are just as bad or worse.

**(Exception)**

- The justification must be sufficient and logical enough to conjure up a the response
    - Two wrongs make a right could be not fallacious if it's a justified response Ex:
        
        Police officer: Why did you spray this man with pepper spray?
        You: Because he attacked me with a knife. I did it in self-defense.
        

 

### -Difference between-

**Look Who's Talking**

The look whoâ€™s talking fallacy always involves a charge of hypocrisy or failing to practice what one preaches; the two wrongs make a right fallacy often does not.

**Two Wrongs Make a Right**

The two wrongs make a right fallacy always
involves an attempt to justify an apparently
wrongful act; the look whoâ€™s talking fallacy
often does not.

Arguments can commit both 'Look Who's Talking' and 'Two Wrongs Make a Right' Fallacy

## 5. Scare Tactic

arguer threaten harm to the listener or reader if they don't accept the arguer's conclusion.

- The threat doesn't relate any way to the conclusion
- Threats can be non-physical

**(Exception)**

- If the threat is relevant to the conclusion it is not a fallacy
- If it is a statement instead of an argument it's not a fallacy

## 6. Appeal to Pity

Inappropriately attempt to evoke empathy, pity, or compassion to the listener to make irrational choices.

- The premises are not in any way relevant to the conclusion

**(Exception)**

- If the premise is relevant and helps the conclusion it is not fallacy.

## 7. Bandwagon Argument

to argue something is true because many people accept that it is so.

- Many people believing something does not mean it's factually true.

**Common Pattern:**

1. Everybody (or a select group of people) believes or does X.
2. Therefore, you should believe or do X, too.

**(Exception)**

- If the people's belief is understandable, logical, and relevant to the conclusion
    
    All the villagers Iâ€™ve talked to say that the water is safe to drink. Therefore,
    the water probably is safe to drink. (Inductive)
    

## 8. The Straw Man Fallacy

arguer distort or misinterpret an opponent's argument to more easily attack it. 

- Attempt to take opponent's argument to the extreme, out of context, to say it's not logical stance.

**Common Pattern:**

1. Xâ€™s view is false or unjustified (but where Xâ€™s view has been unfairly characterized or misrepresented).
2. Therefore, Xâ€™s view should be rejected.

## 9. The Red Herring

to distract the audience by bringing up an irrelevant issue and implying the argument is proven by the irrelevant issue.

Changing the topic isn't fallacy **(Exception)**

- To evade and ignore an issue. Not bringing up irrelevant point to argue

### -Differences between-

**The Straw Man Fallacy**

The straw man fallacy always involves misrepresenting another personâ€™s argument or claim; the red herring fallacy often does not.

**The Red herring**

The red herring fallacy always involves
changing or evading the issue; the straw
man fallacy often does not.

## 10. Equivocation

is committed when a keyword with multiple meanings is used to prove a point to be true even though its not logical

- Ex
    
    It is a crime to smoke grass. Kentucky bluegrass is a grass. Therefore, it is a
    crime to smoke Kentucky bluegrass. (first grass meant marijuana, while the second grass meant lawn grass)
    

**Common Pattern:**

1. All Aâ€™s are Bâ€™s.

2. C is an A (Wrong) | C is a D (Corrected)

3. Therefore C is a B

(A is a double meaning term)

## 11. Begging the Question

Rephrasing and restating the conclusion as the premise

- Ex:
    
    Bungee-jumping is dangerous because itâ€™s unsafe.
    

**Circular Reasoning or Arguing in a Circle**

- The conclusion is stated as true and acts as one of the premises.
- A because B, B because A.
