# Colonialism
- Colonialism is defined as the occupation and control of one nation by another. 
- European nations have been the most active colonizers in many parts of the world especially in Africa. 
- The four reasons for colonization start from 
	1. the strong economic motivation which was the search for sources of raw materials and a market for manufactured goods for its industrialization. 
	1. from the politics and nationalism that made them compete for colonies to be the strongest. 
	1. ideologies of racial hierarchy to enlighten and civilize people
	1. the expansion of Christian missionary that justified and legitimized the colonial endeavor among the European powers and their citizens.
## The Treaty of Berlin and the “Scramble for Africa” 
- One of the chief justifications for this so-called 'scramble for Africa' was a desire to stamp out slavery once and for all.
- To avoid clashes among European countries, German Chancellor Otto at a conference in 1884 initiated the treaty during which the European countries were rush to control of the territories in Africa. 
- The treaty served four main interests of the European countries. 
	1. assured that European nations could access to various important trade routes particularly along the Niger and Congo river basins. 
	2. a concern to suppress the internal slave trade.
	3. only Europeans having the rights to own guns, 
	4. occupation of territories in Africa was discussed. 
	- By 1900, almost 90% of Africa was under European control.

## There are four types of colonial rules
1. economic companies which were any establishment of European nation private companies that were granted large territories to administrate in Africa. 
2. The direct rule: is a form of colonialism that involves the establishment of a centralized authority with a territory that is run by colonial officials. Another type is indirect rule. The British used this type of colonial rule to govern their colonies. This system of governance used indigenous African rules from the colonial administration even though they often had an inferior rule. The last rule is settler rule which is the type of colonialism in Southern Africa in which European settlers directly rules their colonies. Settler colonies came from the other colonies in Africa in a significant number of immigrants from Europe settled in these colonies. The immigrants were not the same as missionaries or European colonial officials.
1. Indirect Rule: Primarily, the British used indirect rule to govern their colonies. This system of governance used indigenous African rulers within the colonial administration, although they often maintained an inferior role. Overall, it was a more cooperative model than direct rule. **Lord** **Lugard**, a British colonial administrator, used this system of government first in Nigeria and later brought it to British East Africa. This system of government assumed that all Africans were organized as “tribes” with chiefs. However, this was not always the case. You will remember from [Module 7(A](http://exploringafrica.matrix.msu.edu/curriculum/unit-two/module-seven/)) that people in Africa had diverse types of government ranging from highly centralized states to “stateless societies.” As a result, indirect rule increased divisions between ethnic groups and gave power to certain “big men” who had never had it before in precolonial history. Consequences of these significant changes in social organization and identity are still being felt today. These issues will be discussed in more detail in _Module Ten: African Politics and Government._
2. Settler Rule: Settler rule refers to the type of colonialism in southern Africa in which European settlers imposed direct rule on their colonies. Settler colonies differed from other colonies in Africa in that a significant number of immigrants from Europe settled in these colonies. These immigrants or settlers were not like missionaries or European colonial officials. Just like early European immigrants to the United States and Canada, settlers in Africa planned to make the colonies their permanent home. As you will learn in _Module Nine: African Economies_ and _Module Ten: African Politics and Government,_ in order to thrive in the colonies, settlers demanded special political and economic rights and protection. Security and prosperity for the settlers depended on economic exploitation and political oppression of the African population that vastly outnumbered the settlers. Consequently, settler rule was characterized by its harsh policies toward the indigenous African population.
	- Settler colonies were found primarily in southern Africa including the colonies of South Africa, Southern and Northern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe and Zambia), Angola, Mozambique, and South West Africa (Namibia). Settlers from Holland, Britain, Germany, and Portugal colonized these areas. In addition, settler rule was practiced in Kenya, a British colony in East Africa, and in Algeria, a French colony in North Africa.
