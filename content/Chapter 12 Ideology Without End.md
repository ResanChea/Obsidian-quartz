# Introduction

Ideologies had shaped social transformations and political development

Endism: idea of the 'end of ideology' (50s-60s)

- No Normative Issues: Large scale division of how society should be doesn't exist anymore
- Delivery of Prosperity: Focus more on how to deliver the common goal most effectively

What is the role of ideology play in human history?

Is ideologies irrelevant today?

# 1. Endism *(50s-60s)*

'End of Ideology': broad argument of how ideology became irrelevant for politics, pushed by [[Daniel Bell\|Daniel Bell]] (more extreme)

Characterized by WW2:

- Economic has triumphed over politics
- Broad agreement by major powers in one common ideology
- Fascism and communism lost their appeal
- Debated about how to best deliver on economic growth and prosperity

Rebuttal to [[Daniel Bell\|Daniel Bell]] 

1. The agreed upon common goal of managed capitalism is a ideology
    - Value of private property, material incentive
    - Kept in check by social welfare and economic intervention

---

The common ideology was only temporary

- 2.  1960s rise of New Left Ideas: revival of leftist ideologies
    - Anarchism
    - Feminism
    - Marxism
    - Ecologism
- 3. 1970s rise of New Right Theories: revived interests in
    - Free-market doctrines
    - Stimulated development

---

- 4. [[Daniel Bell\|Daniel Bell]] neglected strong communism in the East only focused on the west
    - Soviet Union
    - Eastern Europe
    - China

## 1.1. End of History

A broader perspective of '*The End of History and the Last Man*' by [[Francis Fukuyama\|Francis Fukuyama]] growing confidence of the West

- Western Liberalism won the ideological debate: the common desirability of liberal concepts as the only ideology/political system
    - Liberal democracy
    - Market economy
    - Open & competitive political system
- Liberal democracy made impressive progress in 20th century

Rebuttal to [[Francis Fukuyama\|Francis Fukuyama]]: biased to western values

- End of 20th century: revival of Islamism in (only temporary democracy victory)
    - Asia
    - Africa
    - Soviet Union
    - Industrialized West
- 'Good Society' is one that fulfil asperations of all major groups of citizens
    - Capitalist market does not benefit all class equally
- Marxism and communism still existed

## 1.2. Irrelevancy of Left and Right

Another form of 'Endism' is Postmodernity


üè¢ Modernism: is foundationalism through the enlightenment ideas and theories offer rival conceptions of a good life.
Postmodernity: doubts meta-narratives



beliefs that can be concretely proven through rational and logical reasoning and premises

19th & 20th century: Competing ideological positions and arguments offered different solutions to essentially the same problem.

Ex: issue of industrial society solved by balance between 
$$
\begin{cases} 
\bullet \textsf{ Market Autonomy}\\ 
\bullet \textsf{ State control} 
\end{cases}
$$

Why the decline of left/right divide?

1. End of Cold War: Left (US) winning over Right (Soviet)
    - Politics started to be more about culture rather than ideologies
    - Fall of Soviet led to rise of Islamism, China, and India threatening the West culture
2. Globalization:
    - People's lives effected by events far from them
    - Emergence of 'post traditional' social order and social reflexivity
    - No ideology can fully explain the complex reality created by globalization

## 1.3. Triumph of Reason


üî¨ Scientism: the method of acquiring knowledge through a process of careful observation and the testing of hypotheses by reproducible experiments



Ideology may be in the process of being replaced by scientism

- Ideology only serves as a vehicle for advancing class interests
- Science: advances human knowledge from irrational beliefs and political ideologies

Is Science an Ideology?

it can be viewed as a ideology.

- Science links to powerful social forces
- Shape peoples attitude to truth, justice, and knowledge

Beneficiary: transnational corporations who are increasingly responsible for funding scientific and technological development

# 2. The Resilience of Ideology

Each version of Endism works on an ongoing framework of ideological thinking

Supports the end of ideology in replacement of Endism as another ideology

- Scientism replacing ideology would also be another ideology

What is the source of ideology's survival and success?

1. Flexibility: ideologies changes or replaced in response to changing social and historical circumstances
2. Broader Historical Narrative: ideology gives people a reason to believe something larger than themselves, hope, vision, ideal society.
3. Attachment to Ideological Roots: without ideology, parties left/right sells leaders/policies rather than emotional attached idealized state.
