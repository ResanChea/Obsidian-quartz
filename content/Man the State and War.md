- Author: [[Kenneth Waltz\|Kenneth Waltz]]
- The book argues that an international system has three components
    1. Interacting Units are states, impossible to be anything else
    2. Ordering Principle: rule of interaction between units. Between two rules
        - Hierarchical: not possible
        - Anarchic: only choice
    3. Distribution of Power: who is big and who is small. The only characteristic of a system that varies and changeable
        - Uni-polarity
        - Bi-polarity
        - Multi-polarity
    
    Waltz says the system's polarity is the only variable that can change
    
    - and when it does change it leads to world wars
        1. says uni-polarity always create a coalition against them
        2. multi-polarity will create many opportunities for war
            - when alliances happen even for the smallest country the international system becomes unstable and creates multiple potential enemies for the entire system
            
            
            ðŸ’¡ Both WW1&2 started from small countries expanding their power in a multipolar world.
            
            
            
        3. bi-polarity is the most stable and will last forever
            - even if one super power got every power in the int system to go against the other super power, it doesn't mean that much
