- Why tourism is important to economy
- Topic: What are the impacts of globalization on Cambodia's Tourism
    1. How has the globalized tourism sector impacted Cambodia?
        - Economical Impacts - Kannan
            - Cambodia started globalizing fast because [^1]
                - the ASEAN and WTO regional and global platforms have allowed Cambodia to step into international trade discussions with various trading partners either bilaterally or multilaterally
                - Cambodia has tapped benefits from theÂ Everything But Arms (EBA)Â policy of the EU andÂ the Most Favored Nation (MFN)Â of the US
            - The number of foreign visitors to Cambodia significantly increased from less than half a million in 2000 to about 2.5 million in 2010, as reported byÂ the Ministry of Tourism. [^1]
            - Free movement of goods and services
                - Foreign owned businesses: outgoing profits
                - Excess tourism turns it unsustainable [^2]
            - Economical: tourism, SME, FDI, Foreign Trade Agreements
                - infrastructural, roads, accommodations, modernizations, and development of many parts of Cambodia to better accommodate tourism sector
                
                
                ðŸ’¡ Ex: foreign oriented businesses, Chinese gangs, gambling
                
                
                
        - Societal Impacts - Resan
            - Water shortage â€“ It is very evident that the tourism industry overuses the water resources for the development of golf courses, swimming pools, hotels, and even the personal use of water by some tourists. [^2]
            - Tourism may positively impact Cambodia and the large cities in terms of economic advantages, employment opportunities, foreign exchange earnings, and growth in the service sector, however very little of these benefits trickle down to remote areas and rural communities. [^2]
        - Environmental Impact - Lychhing
            - Forests regularly endure the destructive effect of tourism due to **deforestation** created by land clearing for hotels, as well as being used as building material and fuel for the tourism industry. [^2]
            - **Loss of natural habitat and wildlife** due to loss of natural environment and forest that leads to degradation of local biodiversity. As many as 23 endangered or critically endangered species can be found in just one corner of Cambodia, in the wilderness that gently bumps up to Vietnamâ€™s boarders. [^2]
    2. How has the recent COVID-19 pandemic affected the globalized and tourism-reliant Cambodia? [^1] - Sovachana
        - How globalization has made Cambodia reliant on tourism?
        - Cross border transactions, functional organizations
