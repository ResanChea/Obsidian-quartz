Competition between the rising East(USSR) and the rich west (US) in the 1960s

- The space race: USSR's Sputnik, first in space

The quickness of USSR's growth was due to the large increase in **Input**

**Problems**: 

- Efficiency of each input unit or **output** > Larger and larger **input**
- Sacrifice current consumption for the sake of future production
- Input focused production is bound to hit industrial expansion limit

Technological advancements ⇒ increase in growth in both **input** and **efficiency**.

Mobilizing of resources ⇒ increase in growth in input

Asian Newly Industrialized Countries have the same mobilizing of resources method of growth

- Increased size of labor force
- Increased education
- Physical Capital

Singapore succeeded because it already had a quiet good efficiency of production, it just lacked capital, labor, and inputs
