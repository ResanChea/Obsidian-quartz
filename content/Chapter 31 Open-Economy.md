# Exchange Rate

Appreciation: increase in value of a currency measured by the currency's power to buy another currency.

Depreciation: decrease in value of a currency measured by the currency's power to buy another currency.

## Nominal Exchange Rate

the rate at which one country's currency trade for another country's currency

$\large e=\frac{P^* }{P}$

## Real Exchange Rate

The rate at which G&S of one country trade for the G&S of another country

Real Exchange Rate = $\large \frac{e\times P}{P^*}$

P = domestic price

P* = Foreign price
