- Take a tomatoe, cut the top and bottom stem parts off. Let it cook with your rice. When it's done, crack and egg over it and let it steam some more till white is opaque. Super delicious when you mix it all together.[^1]
- I use a pot vs rice cooked but jazzing up rice has become one of my favorite tricks.

- Ginger and chopped nuts is nice, I add golden raisins at the end.

- Saute garlic and onion in EVOO add curry or tumeric powder before adding the rice.

- Lime zest before and chopped cilantro as a finish with the juice.

- Chopped carrots can be nice.

- I try to think of the things that can handle boiling that would go with the flavor profile and add them. A flavor profile chart can be a big help as well.
