# Genocide

# Definition of Genocide [^2]

- **Genocide** means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group as such: (article II Genocide Convention of 1948)
	1. Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
	2. Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
	3. Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
	4. Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.
- Genocide is always justified as an act of self-defense
	- They exist ⇒ they are a threat to us
	- It’s a mobilizing mechanism to go to war against a group

# Key challenges of dealing with genocide [^2]

- Solutions that didn't yield:
    - diplomatic pressure, the UN resolutions, arms embargo, creation of international court to prosecute war criminals, UN peacekeepers, and "Safe Areas" designation.
        - Arms embargo hurt people who wanted to protect themselves
    - Actions either counterproductive or there is no action at all.
    - The Rwanda Genocide was ignored, acted too late; saves only whites, “Rwanda was simply insignificant to save”
    - East Timor was saved only at the very spur of a small network of activists, that the West intervened.
        - Activists in Australian cities to gain attention and call for action
- Attempts to challenge rules of genocide:
    - state argued they want to maintain sovereignty and non-interference in one’s domestic affairs ⇒ So genocide shouldn’t be an international law
- Responsibility to Protect (R2P): been gaining momentum
    - Intervention from non-involving countries to stop genocide
