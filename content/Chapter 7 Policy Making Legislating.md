Comparative Governments study relations Executive $\leftrightarrows$ Legislative bodies

- Check and balances

Problem Legislature isn't as powerful as Executive anymore

What are the main functions of the legislative body?

# 1. Making laws between executives and legislatures

government divided executive & legislative to:

- depend on each other
- limit each other
- powers are mixed: work together


ðŸ“ƒ Legislation is the body of laws that have been passed by the legislature.
Legislating is thus the act of initiating, debating and passing such laws



Legislation is passed when executive & legislative agrees

Modern government doesn't have checks and balances anymore. 

- Executive is the prominent power
- Legislative is 'just a rubber stamp'

# 2. Reasons why executive power is increasing

1. Government Complexity: The need for Executive as the single center of coordinating and control to manage different agencies, departments, and units of governments working together.
    - the growing interdependent world creates more complex problems for the government to handle.
        - Nuclear power
        - The environment
        - The economy
2. Delegated Legislation: as laws have many circumstances and changes quickly, laws have to be written very generally. Interpretation and details of cases has to be decided by executives.
    
    
    ðŸ“ƒ Delegated legislation Law or decrees made by ministers, not by legislatures, though in
    accordance with powers granted to them by the legislative body.
    
    
    
3. Organization Advantage of Executive:  
    - Small in number: easier for common interest, react quickly
    - Well-funded: work in presidential and prime ministerial offices
    - Held highly by Political leaders: can appeal to public
4. Mass Media: executive use mass media for as much publicity as possible on TV. While legislature is too large and divided to act with a single voice.
5. Party Organization: Strong political party â†’ strong executive & weaker legislative
6. Emergency power: executive need to respond quickly and effectively to threats of pandemics, natural disasters and terrorism

## Supposed Evidence for Increasing power of executive

From *Source: Inter-Parliamentary Union, Parliaments of the World (New York: Facts on File, 1992).*

- Most bills are introduced by executives
- Most bills introduced by executives are accepted by legislative and become law

$\uparrow$ Explained by 'The Law of Anticipated Reactions' - Karl Friedrich

> "Both executive and legislative will sound out what is likely to be accepted and adjust their proposals accordingly as to not waste time."
> 

# 4. The functions of legislatures

## 4.1. The representation of public opinion

Main assembly is directly elected to reflect public opinion

- Reflect party political opinion
- Reflect political interests of specific groups

Legislative must represent the main clusters of public opinions (Interest aggregation) and express them in policy debates (Interest articulation).

- Proportional representative
- 2/3 majority votes


ðŸ“ƒ Interest aggregation Sorting the great variety of political attitudes and opinions on a political issue, to reduce it to a more simple, clear-cut and agreed â€˜packageâ€™ of opinion.
Interest articulation The expression of political demands in order to influence public policy.



 **Criticism**

Government positions are not representative of actual people

- the four M(s)
    - middle-class
    - middle-aged
    - majority group
    - males
- professionalized
- require political life
- high education

 **Objection**

- politicians can represent the views of social groups rather than their own
- politicians represent views of political parties

## 4.2. The legitimation of government and the political system

Legitimation is ensured by a legislative that

- Is elected directly
- Meets regularly for public political debates


ðŸ“ƒ Legitimation The process of making something morally acceptable, proper, or right in the eyes of the general public.



Peaceful opposition: It Means those who oppose government will accept its election and can run for legitimacy themselves next term

## 4.3. Legislative in Law making

Don't initiate bills, What Legislative can do to bills:

- consider
- change details
- throw out bills
- change their fundamental intent

Debates & readings in both chambers swinging back and forth between legislative and executive until its accepted.

## 4.4. Legislative on executive scrutiny of the administration of the state

Legislative is supposed to keep executive from abusing power using:

- Examining government bills
- Veto power: for some legislative bodies, if against constitution...
- Have approving executive appointments (vote of confidence) to nominate cabinet members... to represent government
- Presidents and PM must explain their actions
- Public Debates let the public criticize and scrutinize executive points
- Veto of no confidence/impeachment
- Committees: examine for scrutiny of executive

# 5. The reform of legislatures: legislative committees

Create effective and powerful legislative committees to make sure no legislative oversight, abuse of power, over see performance of government 

- Unbiased Small committee (15-30)
- Experience & technical expertise
- Bureaucratic support & time


ðŸ“ƒ Legislative oversight The role of the legislature that involves the scrutiny or supervision of other branches of government, especially the executive and the public bureaucracy.



# Theories of democratic institutions:

Diversity of formal democratic arrangements turn into a few general repeating patterns

- Constitutional documents fall into four specific parts
- Relations executive $\leftrightarrows$ legislative relations into presidential, semi-presidential, parliamentary
- Organizing territorial government: federal and unitary

*Arendt Lijphart (1936â€“)* study found democracies fall into **

- Majoritarian: give unconstrained power to the majority and the party that represent them
- Consensus: diversify power and limit its uses
- Critiques
    - too broad and general to apply to all cases, many exceptions
    - Variations of both with or without some features

## Majoritarian Democracy

- Give concentrated power to who holds majority in legislative assembly
- Fuses executive and legislative powers
- Constitution can be changed for majority vote in legislature
- Most often unitary state, also control units of governments below

Ex: United Kingdoms

## Consensus Democracy

Shares power 

- Create coalition of parties in government
- Separate & balanced executive and legislative
- Often federal, decentralized but given governmental autonomy to states
- Balanced bicameral legislative assemblies
- Have judicial review of political and constitutional matters
- constitutional inflexibility
- Have proportional elections, multi-party systems, corporatist interest group systems, and independent central banks.

Between Majoritarian and Consensus which performs better?

Consensus Democracy because:

- Representation: It includes and represent as many group as possible
- Check and Balance: The government share and separate power between the main parties and between the two representative assemblies
- Accountability: It reinforces the rights of all citizens by giving the courts the right to review constitutional matters and public policy
