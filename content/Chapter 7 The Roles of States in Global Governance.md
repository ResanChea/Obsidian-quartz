# 1. States and Global Governance: A Complex Interaction

IGOs depend of states

- States fund IGOs
- IGOs are only powerful when powerful states comply with them, needs approval

How do states behave according to different theories?

- Neoliberals Institutionalists: states are influenced by the institutions and networks.
- Realists: states preferences, interests, and actions are formed from their position in the int' system.
- Constructivist: norms, IGOs, NGOs, can change states identity.
- Principle-Agent Theorists: focus on complex interactions between states.

What factors shape roles states play in global governance?

- State's relative power: the more power/wealth a state have the more it can shape global governance
    - Hegemony: creates IGOs to consolidate their influence. in favor of the rich & powerful.
    
    Ex: Veto power P5
    
    - Wealthy states use funding for influence over IGOs

Why states participate in piece of global governance?

they participate in global governance for their national interests by:

- Principal-agent theorists: they use IGOs for tasks they can't achieve themselves
- Functionalism: they use functional organizations to solve specific issues such as non-sensitive cooperation.
- Collective Goods Theorists: states depend on IOs to provide public goods such as health care.
- Neoliberal Institutionalist: states use IOs to legitimize their actions and that their commitment is credible.

What makes interaction between states and global governance complex?

Sovereignty is what makes it complex

- when there is conflict: who has rights to control internal sovereignty
- States sovereignty is limited by international law

Why states choose to relinquish sovereign authority to international institutions?

IGOs can have high authority able to give states:

- Platform to settle disputes: ICJ
- Public Goods by hegemon
- Aid and Peacekeeping missions

# 2. The Key Roles of the U.S.

US shapes the postwar international system

- Establish many IGOs
- Promote International laws:
    - UN charter is consistent with US interests
- US use IGOs to create institutions and rules according to their interests
    - Iraq invasion, counter terrorism etc.
- US rejected from many institutions memberships

How US practice Unilateralism?

- US isn't bound by obligations of UN Charter
    - war against Iraq without UN authorization
- Bush: use of force as pre-emptive attacks

Other states response 

How US practice Multilateralism?

- US recognized the multilateralism in war on terrorism
- To nuclear proliferate through NATO

## The relationship between US and IGO depend on the factors:

## 2.1. US power in the international system

There are 2 beliefs in the political culture

- Exceptionalism: US has an obligation and responsibility to promote those values and using international institutions.
- Exemptionism: US should be forgiven or exempt from some of those rules governing others in order to protect its sovereignty.

## 2.2. Domestic politics

- Presidential leaderships and executive-legislative relations.
- Domestic groups and public opinion -) US foreign policy
- Congress control the budget -) source of power in international institution.

## 2.3. The characteristics of various pieces of global governance

- pieces of global governance influence by US leaderships roles in the institutions
- pieces of global governance depend on US budget and need to follow US preference to gain budget

# 3. Other Powerful States

## 3.1. The Soviet Union

(1922-1991)  to Russia (1991-Now)

- Created 2 regional organizations
- Vetoed western objectives from happening
- Pushed self-determination for colonial states (independence)

## Great Britain or the United Kingdom and France

        all of which were rejected by the United States
        
- In the economic sphere, both the United Kingdom and France have played a key role in providing innovative ideas and approaches to dressing the 2008-2009
international financial crisis L:

## China

Largest population, economy and very influential power

China's view and role of governance has changed

- Before: they believed global governance was a western idea, didn't participate
    - joined UN to kick Taiwan out of UN
        - Joined other IGOs and UN agencies to gain legitimacy, but not participate much
- After: from self-isolation to integration. Why?
    - Realism:
        - China wants to enhance its power and influence in regional and global diplomacy through Institutions
        - Sovereignty still is a concern to keep authoritarian regime, keep their human rights practice
    - Liberalism: China increasing independence, realized that institutionalized cooperation is needed for future growth

## German

Didn't join until both Germanys joined UN in 1973

## Japan

Joined UN in 1953

- in 1992, The Japanese parliament approve legislation
permitting up to 2000 Japanese troops to deploy in UN

    Ex: 
    
    - India decline UN role in ending long running dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir
    - Refused to sign NPT
    - kIncreased military power to gain security role in oceans

## Brazil

More independent from US due to globalization

Donate lots of money to UN peacekeeping missions

# 4. Middle Power States

States which are not a major power but are big enough to depend on themselves. 

1. They put themselves in the world
    
    They help UN peacekeepers by providing materials and human resources (Canada)
    
2. Promote multilateralism
    
    Canada participate in ASEAN Regional forum
    

# 5. Developing States

# 6. States Strategies

## Forum Shopping

States have many options to choose from many forms to one that will have best reception for them.

- Labor: ILO, WTO, EU
- Environmental: UNEP, WB, Commission on Sustainable Development

## Coalition building

It serves pragmatic and organizational purpose by pooling smaller powers for a bigger voice.

Non-Aligned Movement (Global South)

- Happens every 3 years without a structure
- Charing state rotates every 3 years as caucus in UN

Ex: Arab-Israeli Issue: to not pick either US or Soviet, neither sides

## Organization of the Islamic Conference

To safeguard Holy Palace and support the people of Palestine to regain their rights and liberate their land.

Failed in:

- Safeguarding its primary issue: US's war on terrorism caused Muslims to mistrust each other
- Terrorism: divided on the issue of terrorism as they define non-Islamic as terrorists

## Ad Hoc Multilateralism

are less binding or obligation for member states than permanent institutions

are Informal groups of states that help UN peace-related efforts

- Quarlet: solving Arab-Israeli issue
- Haiti
- G-20

# Explaining State Policies and Strategies

What explains state choices

## Systematic Factor

Anarchic nature & distribution of capabilities among states explain actions

- Hegemonic Stability Theory: US willing to pay for upholding international order
- Dependency Theory: Developing states depend on powerful states?

## Domestic Politics

States choose to cooperate multilaterally & predisposition towards Global Governance

- Authoritarian states: don't comply with IGOs' rules with human rights & sovereignty...

## Characteristics of Pieces of Global Governance

- States can benefit from specialized NGOs
- Gain services from states cannot gain by themselves
- Influenced by accepted norms and benefits of multilateralism (rational choice theory?)

# Challenges of Multilateral Diplomacy

1. Negotiation Across Culture
- Cultural & Language differences (cause misunderstanding)
    
    Lost in translation
    

2. Difference in value, mannerism, verbal and non-verbal communication

- High context culture: careful wording to protect themselves from misunderstandings (ASEAN way)
- Low context culture: are problem solving oriented, hurried to save face.

# Leadership and Facilitating Agreement

Power-steering: getting agreement among small groups of key states then getting others to agree.

# Conclusion

Role of states in global governance have complex relationships and many different types of states.
