- Secularization: when an actor claims something is a threat to the existence of the victim thing
    - Normally the actor is a government authority: who is a self-referencing actor of what is a threat
    - Authority must present the threat and be accepted by the reference audience to be a threat
        - To be able to declare a state of emergency, the authority must mobilize force and support for taking drastic actions
