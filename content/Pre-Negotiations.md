# Pre-Negotiations

## 1. What is Pre-Negotiation

- The first step of [[Negotiation\|Negotiation]] is pre-negotiation
    - The talks about the upcoming talks
    - Pre-negotiation is not outside of negotiation process
        - Its very busy for delegates/negotiators
    - conducted by negotiators
- Tasks of Negotiators during pre-negotiation:
    - Setting agenda
    - prepare necessary procedures to tackle certain issue
    - Bilateral (Informal)
    - Multilateral (Complex/Formal)
    - Bring party into discussion
        - Parties must agree to conditions for discussions
        - To avoid heated conflicts during negotiation
        - Encourage agreement by the end

## 2. Factors that Determine if Actors will Agree to Negotiate

- domestic security (political security): winning or losing election
    - If joining negotiation will lose popular support, the leader wonâ€™t negotiate
- preconditions demanded by hard liners
- lack of (perceived) stalemate (other option is more beneficial)
    - (perceived) **Hurting stalemate**: enemyâ€™s belief they will not able to move forward or any other options than negotiating
        - Forces recalculation of options
        
        ðŸ’¡ Ex: Cambodia-Thailand fighting, Thailand thought it could easily win, but it paid a big price â†’ perceived stalemate
        
        - Cost vs Benefits: Tolerance against fighting, sanctions, morale
        - If a state is not in hurting stalemate and expect to win, it will not concede or stop fighting (Russia in [[Ukraine-Russia Conflict\|Ukraine-Russia Conflict]])
- parties believe that time is on their sides:
    - The longer you delay, the more options you have
- agreeing to negotiate is a sign of weakness (loss of bargaining power during the negotiation)
    - Agreeing to negotiate is accepting you have no other choice
- high stake sensitive conflict (religion, culture...)
    - Religious city, temple, holy grounds cannot be divided and shared
    - Negotiation is unlikely to occur
- Record of past hostility towards that party (Ex: Trump vs China)
- No interrupting incidents: terrorist attacks, protest

## 3. Problems of Agenda Content and Order

- After parties agree to negotiate, state still need to know whatâ€™s on the agenda
- **Content**: A proposed agenda might be â€˜prejudicialâ€™ rather than â€˜neutralâ€™
    - It might indicate that one party has already conceded a vital point of substance.
        - The picking of a topic might benefit one party
    - A party could use the agenda contents to publicize its propaganda
        - Agendas will be public or leaked
        - A party put agenda items that has no hope of reaching concessions, but it aims to show off its own policies
            - If a larger power concedes to put content preferable to the smaller power, the small power will gloat of its power & influence
    - The opposing party can push a vague agenda
        - If agenda is left too vague, the party who didnâ€™t want to discuss will have to have formal discussion to clarify
        - One party might talk about irrelevant issues instead
- **Order**: Parties believe theyâ€™ll have to give concessions on some items to receive some benefits.
    - Parties want items they think theyâ€™d win to come first
        - Create impression of strength and avoid trouble at home
        - Make opponent seek reciprocity in giving concessions now in hoping for benefits later
        - Fear of giving concessions first, but not receiving concessions later on
    - Solution: I promise to do X, if you promise to do Y

# Five Procedural Issues that Need Resolving

## 1. Secrecy

- **Secret Diplomacy**: involves keeping the secrets of ([[Levels of Analysis of Foreign Policy\|Levels of Analysis of Foreign Policy]])
    - The contents of the negotiation
    - Knowledge that negotiations are going on
    - The content of any agreement issuing from negotiations
    - The fact that any agreement at all has been reached
- Why: Each side has to settle for less than ideal
    - If radical government supporters hear the government is making concessions or being â€˜bought outâ€™ they might sabotage the talks from happening
    - Knowing actual position of opponent state might give advantage

## 2. Format

Explain the different formats of negotiations and their strengths and weaknesses:

- **Direct**: will be employed when the parties have normal relations and in routine matters it might readily be agreed that an embassy will play a leading role
    - quick and for states with friendly relations
- **Indirect**: better for bitter rivals using mediator or good office
    - Normally both parties stay in close proximity such as in one hotel to help mediator
    - Strength: overcome the issue of losing prestige
- **Bilateral vs Multilateral** discussion
    - Parallel Bilateral is good for flexibility, speed, and secrecy
        - Weakness: secrecy means other allied parties might seek separate deals with rivals
    - Multilateral
        - Slow and time consuming
- A **combination of Bilateral and Multilateral**
    - Bilateral discussion first â†’ share what is discussed in planery (multilateral) session
- Choice of format is thus heavily influenced by factors such as
    - the degree of urgency attending a negotiation
    - the state of relations among allies
    - the determination of the most powerful or most resolute among the parties as to which format will best suit its own interests.
        - Weaker states generally prefer to negotiate with the more powerful in a multilateral forum,
        - since the environment is more regulated and their chances of forming coalitions are greater

## 3. Venue

- How are negotiation venues important to actors?
    - In friendly bilateral relationship: discussing low importance issues, selecting venue isnâ€™t difficult
        - Home: Britain take pride in its own diplomats â‡’ venue negotiations at Britain
            - delivered quickly and securely to the right people, and are not distorted en route
            - If the state is able to persuade their rivals to send a delegation to their own shores,
	            - it is a great practical convenience: having all resources it needs
	            - Furthermore, it also suggests that it is the more powerful of the two so the traveler will suffer the loss of face.
        - Away
- How are negotiation venues usually selected?
    - Venue are usually selected based on neutrality.
        
    >[!example] ðŸ’¡ Ex: 
    >Countries, such as Switzerland and Austria are both permanently neutral based on international law. The Congress of Vienna and The Hague served as examples.
        
    - In order to save face, states can choose a venue where they can meet somewhere geographically in between their own countries.
    - States can avoid any loss of prestige over the issue of venue by agreeing to alternate between their respective capitals.
        - Taking turns traveling is a reasonable solution after a diplomatic breakthrough.

## 4. Delegations

- What issues concerning delegations do negotiators have to agree upon? How are those issues important?
    - The level: the higher it is, the more priority is put, and rapid progress is expected
        - Who is lead negotiator: if its a president or head of state
            - Shows you are committed about issue
            - No need to consult with top leaders
            - Weakness: cannot delay, have to make decisions on the spot â†’ possible error
        - Lower-level talks can be better for delegates to speak personally and directly
            - Weakness: Many delays
    - The size:
        - if its too small, it implies lack of seriousness or purpose
        - If its too big, there problems of accommodation and security
    - The composition of a party by putting names on individuals and groups could hurt a partyâ€™s interest
        - Agreeing to negotiate with a group you donâ€™t recognize could hurt your national image.
        
        ðŸ’¡ Ex: Israel viewed Palestinians as Jordanians, if it conceded Palestinians as a separate identity, it would mean accepting national self-determination of Palestine as a state. No delegates can come from the Hamas group
        
## 5. Timing

- Why negotiators should or should not press for the commencement of negotiations as soon as possible.
    - **Between Friends**: When the conditions or offer is favorable because the deal wonâ€™t stay forever â‡’ must press for negotiation ASAP
    - **Between Enemies**: neither sides want to be initiator of negotiation because it shows desperation, weakness, and lack of choice
        - The other side interpret it as weakness and will make many demands â†’ failed negotiation
        - Increase Bargaining Power: by delaying
- Why is it still hard to choose a mutually convenient date for the start of a negotiation?
    - Overlapping meeting schedule: many parties make scheduling very challenging
- What dates should be chosen and should be avoided? Why?
    - Unfavorable or inappropriate: meetings on special occasions, national holidays is not acceptable
