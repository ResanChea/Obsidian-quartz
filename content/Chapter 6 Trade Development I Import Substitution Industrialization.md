Why developing countries distance themselves from ...

# Status of Developing Liberalization

Developing countries were relatively liberal

- Monoexporter: export only one type of product (agriculture)
- Enclave Agriculture:

After WW2: developing countries protected their markets

- Industrialization: shift from agriculture to manufacturing
- Government Intervention: Industrial policy, big push

Why did they switch?

# The Structuralist Critique: Markets, Trade, and Economic

Why shift resources from agricultural production into manufacturing industries

- Higher standard of living is achieved through industrilization
- The shift of industries only happens when governments put policies

## Structuralism

Dependence on agriculture returns less profit than focusing on manufacturing

To do this you need government intervention

- Complementary Demand: all manufacturing industries must start selling at the same time, because industries staff will buy products from each other with their wages
    - Subsistence Economy: people make food and products for the purpose of providing themselves with necessity only, not for export
- Pecuniary External Economy: cooperation is needed for relating industries to increase/decrease their production

Term of Trade: the exporting country has to export lots more to import small amount of manufactured products

- Developing countries get poorer

Why?

Because agricultural products normally go down in price while high-tech manufactured goods will increase

Income Elasticity of Demand: demand for manufactured product will increase as income increase while agricultural products' demand will fall instead

# Types of countries practicing ISI

Import Substitution Industrialization: to domestically produce products which you used to import.

- Stage 1: Easy ISI: are simple consumer goods such as beer, shoes, furniture to serve domestic market
- Stage 2:
    - Secondary ISI: shift from simple manufactured goods to durable goods (cars, intermediate goods, capital goods) (Latin America)
    - Export Substitution Strategy: produce manufactured goods to target exporting to international market (semi-conductor, computers...) (East Asian Countries)
