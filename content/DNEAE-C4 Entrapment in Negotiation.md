Entrapment in International Negotiation is a form of escalation

- Both common an d conflicting interests situations
- International system could become entrapped and get out of control


ðŸ’¡ Ex: confrontation between US and USSR: entrapped in balance of power competition. Lose out on negotiations.



- **Entrapment**: is a decision making process, where people use reasons to justify actions they cannot back down from

# Characteristics

- Choice: entrapment is a result of choices made. The more you choose the narrower your freedom of choices are.
    - Member of ASEAN: less freedom of norms, rules, trade regulations...
    - Process choices or Situation choices
- Uncertainty: some negotiators doesn't know their own situations and other's, end up making wrong decision due to time limitation.
- Investment: Some think emotional investment is more important than material investment.
    - Making decisions to destroy one sector to gain from another sector
- Repetition: entrap others & sometimes themselves into the negotiation process overtime, losing out.

# Levels

1. Intrapersonal
    - Be aware of one's own culture, experience, and impact on one's behavior
    - Investigate the opponent's background to observe their behavior, to know when they're entrapping you.
    - The gap of similarities can bring miscommunication, misperception, and entrapment
2. Interpersonal
    - Chemistry between negotiators determines success or failure, negative or positive feeling
    - Negative feeling: careful of entrapment because of rationality
    - Positive feelings: likely to fall for entrapment because personal views
    - Frequently happens in the international sphere, when negotiators have same thinking (group think & lobbying)
3. National
    - Individualistic: entrapment is less likely
    - Collectivist: entrapment is more likely
    - Competitive: entrap others
    - Cooperative: caring for others
4. International
    - Entrapment begins with misjudgment of the intentions of enemies, hostilities
    - More serious consequences of entrapment than other levels
    - However, less likely to occur because of the naturally less intimate relationships
    - **Powerful states**: use entrapment for smaller states and use the threat of exit
    - Seeking Allies: create more entrapment

# Factors

1. Planning: carefully plan out, to reveal potential traps, linkages, potential deals (Thomas-Kilimann Model)
    - Competition and Accommodation is more likely to fall to entrapment
    - Avoidance, Compromise, and Collaboration is better to avoid entrapments
2. Information: is important to avoid entrapment
    - Full information is very difficult
    - Having reliable source of information
3. Communication: lack of communication, not the whole truth
4. Control: to manage risk of entrapment
    - Join coalitions or ally with a stronger

    - Make sure you're well represented in the power center of your organization
    - Make sure those in power sees your priority as their priority
