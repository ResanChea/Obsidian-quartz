# History and evolution of embassy
## Why were embassies created?
- Middle Ages (400s-1400s): Envoys as messenger of every communication (No permanent offices)
	- Nuncius: are living letters, no power to make decision
	- Plenipotentiary: have power to make decisions for leader (trusted individual, royal family, ...)
	- Problems: Costly, slow, risky
		- Ceremonies to welcome royals
- 1500s: 
	- Ottoman Empire: some diplomatic offices established
	- Slowly spread to Europe but with much resistence
- 1800s: 
	- professionalization of diplomats (training, regular payments, ranks) instead of nepotism
	- debates on [[Diplomatic Immunities\|Diplomatic Immunities]] argued by [[Functionalism\|Functionalism]]
