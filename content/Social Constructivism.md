# Social Constructivism

**Social Constructivism**: school of thought assuming the world is constructed by people's social interactions

### Assumptions [^1] [^2]

- Emphasize role of **idea, perception, identity**
    - Interactions > define Identities > define Interests > define norms
- Believes knowledge and reality is subjective and is defined by discourse and interactions
- The social world's norms, actions, and interests is created by human beings and can be changed (war, peace, cooperation)
    - **Identity shifts** according to your interaction partner
- Social structures: don't exist. common beliefs in structures â†’ following the norm
- [[Materialism\|Materialism]] is part of constructivism but it's the ideas that determine what those materials mean to each actor. Constructivism = Materialism + Shared Ideas

### Global Level Assumptions [^1]

- International System (reality) is defined by International Relations between states (discourse)
- [[Alexander Wendt\|Alexander Wendt]] rejects [[Structural Realism\|Structural Realism]]'s notion that anarchy must lead to self-help.
    - Wendt believes the outcome depends on interactions between states
- [[International Institution\|International Institution]] have power on several dimensions [^2]
    - **Material Power**: control of influential resources. Ex: World Bank has money, UN has troops.
    - **Normative Power**: [[European Union\|European Union]] persuading members to harmonize their institutions and practices with it.
    - **Agenda Setting**: power to decide what is focused on. Ex: UN meeting with predetermined agendas of discussion.

([[Security Dilemma\|Security Dilemma]], Alliances, Anarchy...)
- **Ideational Creation**: Interpretive understanding: different way of describing the world than material way
- **Identity/System Change**: structures and identities change when common ideas change
- **Mutual Constitution**: States and structures co-influence each other.
