# Chapter 2: The Theoretical Foundation of Global Governance

International Relations is based on key concepts of

- Nature & role of individuals
- State's sovereignty
- Interaction among states
- International system

It also addresses Global Governance

- Who govern the International System?
- How global change occur?
- Effects past and present global governance affect the future and vice versa

Middle-Level Theories: pick concepts from multiple different theories in defining international laws and governance.

---

# 1. [[Liberalism\|Liberalism]]

Injustice, aggression, and war can be eliminated through collective/multilateral actions and institutional reform.

The core belief of liberalism are

- The human nature is good
- The serve and promote cooperation and collaboration
- social progress is possible
- human behaviors is malleable and perfectible through institution, aggression

## 1.1. 17th Century First Liberalism Concept

[[Hugo Grotis\|Hugo Grotis]] (1583-1645) asserted that All international relations are subject to

- The law of nations: war is not the right of states
- The law of nature: states are rational and law-biding

---

## 1.2. 18th Century The Enlightenment & Democratic Peace Theory

[[Immanuel Kant\|Immanuel Kant]] (1724-1804)

The Enlightenment contributed to liberalism by that individuals

- are rational human beings
- able to improve their life by creating a just society

Kant focused on the relationship between democracy and peace for the possibility of 'perpetual peace' among democratic nations (Democratic Peace Theory)

---

## 1.3. 19th Century Democratic Deterrent for War

The Enlightenment + Scientific Modernization and Industrial Revolution + Democracy & Free Trade

[[Adam Smith\|Adam Smith]]  and [[Jeremy Bentham\|Jeremy Bentham]]: asserted, free trade raise interdependence

- Raised the cost of war
- Reward cooperation and competitions with peace, prosperity, and justice

This is the basis for Economic Liberalism

## 1.4. Core of 20th Century Liberalism

The core of 20th century Liberalism was 

- The Versailles Treaty: [[Woodrow Wilson\|Woodrow Wilson]]: to prevent war:
    - creating collective security
    - self determination of people
    - eliminating power politics
- The Covenant of the LON: asserted the importance of international organizations for collective problem solving

## 1.5. Why Cooperation Will Grow

### Dynamic International Relations

States learn from their interactions in the international system that changes

States adhere to common

- norms
- institutions & rules
- interests

### Growth With Interdependence

Liberals expect mutual interest to grow along side the growth of

- Interdependence
- Knowledge
- Communication
- The spread of democratic rules

Greater interdependence will promote cooperation, peace, welfare, and justice.

Power matter but exercised within the framework of rule and institution and make international cooperation possible.

---

## 1.6. Role of International Organizations

In **support of cooperation** IOs:

- Contribute to habits of cooperation
- Serve as arena for negotiation and developing coalitions
- Promote development of shared norms

In **keeping peace** by:

- Mitigating the dangers of War
- Operations addressing international problems

For **use by states** in :

- As instruments of foreign relations
- Constrain behaviors of non-compliant states

---

# 2. Neoliberal Institutionalism or [[Neo-Liberalism\|Neo-Liberalism]]

Neoliberal Institutionalists argue that Anarchic world can have cooperation with help from International Organizations

More state-centric view of IR

- States are rational actors
- States are selfish but mutual benefit is better than self-interest
- States have Incentive to Cooperate: to maximize absolute gain

Cooperation is common through International Institutions

- Can solve problems that can't be solved alone

## Role of IOs in Neo-Liberalism

And international organization role is to 

- help solve problem that one state cannot solve
- moderate state behavior
- provide guarantee framework for interaction
- a context for bargaining provide mechanism for reducing cheating by monitoring behavior
- punishing wrong states
- facilitate transparency

## 2.1. Neo-Liberal Perspective on [[Game Theory\|Game Theory]]

[[Robert Axelrod\|Robert Axelrod]] and [[Robert Keohane\|Robert Keohane]] draws on Game Theory

In Game Theory, the self serving behavior of each player leads to bad outcomes for both players

But, by allowing communication, joint-agreements will lead to mutual gain.

Concepts The Game Theory Shown

- Tit-for-tat cooperation will mutually benefit in the long term
- Game Theory applicability varies according to shared norms
- States are independent actors, but their policy choices are interdependent

## 2.2. Continued Relevancy of IOs in Neo-Liberalism

### The Prisoner's Dilemma

Two prisoners are interrogated separately for a crime

- If one confess and the other didn't, the one who confess go free, the silent one takes long sentence
- If both confesses they both get reduced sentences
- If neither confess, they receive short sentences

Without communication, they will both confess, making a bad sentence

With communication, they will agree to keep quiet to get short sentences

The self-serving bias of each player will lead to bad outcome for both players.

Therefore, states communicating and cooperating, looking for mutual interests is more beneficial in the long term.

### Making Cooperation Cheap

States choose continuous interactions with each other because they know they will interact with the same actors in the future.

To Facilitate cooperation cheaply, states create Institutions

- moderate states behavior
- provide framework for interactions
- mechanisms to punish cheaters/defectors
- Facilitate transparency
- Cooperation can come at the expense of other states
    - Regional trade agreements
    - Bilateral Trade
    - Collective Security?

# 3. [[Functionalism\|Functionalism]]

Functionalism assert that governance (global or governmental) arise out of need of people or states.

- International economic and social cooperation will lead to political cooperation and eliminating war
    - In cooperating in non-sensitive areas
    - states can use IGOs to work together
    - eventually leading to more sensitive political cooperation
- Early IGOs developed for cross-border activities
    - International Telegraph Union
    - Universal Postal Union
    - Commission for navigation on the Rhine River
    - World Health Organization
    - UN Children's Fund
    - Food and Agriculture Organization
    - International Labor Organization
    

International Organizations here consist of limited amount of members, focusing on a certain area, either economic, social, or environmental problems.

Functional Relationship: technical experts loses identification with their state, to allegiance of like-minded individuals.

- Like people, states develop functional relationships from economic cooperation

## Problems With Functionalism

- EU will achieve common foreign and security policy. Political decisions may be needed, but actions may not be taken
- Decolonization process was important, but no IO created for it
- International organizations modified global political system, but not transform it
- How can other causes of war, besides economic deprivation, illiteracy, hunger, disease, be alleviated?
- In reality, cooperation spillovers aren't as easy or common as it's proposed.

# 4. International Regime Theory

International Regimes = Set of rules/laws + decision making procedures

States create Regime frameworks to coordinate their actions with those of other states

- Provide info to participants: More clarity or certainty
- Coordination may lead to convergence of interest
- It believe in a system of cooperation in spite of anarchy
- Stresses importance of Non-state actors for cooperation
- International Law consist of informal norms and rules of behaviors, making them codified or institutionalized
- States' actions are affected by norms

# 5. [[Public Good\|Public Good]]  or Collective Good

Goods which can be used by everyone, not owned by anyone

- International water

War comes from the mismanagement of public goods

Free Riding: states could use public good without contributing, making supply limited

# 6. [[Realism\|Realism]]

## 6.1. Core Assumptions of Realism

Human Nature: is selfish, pragmatic, self-reliance

Main Actor: only states and IGO are only tools for IGOs

Cooperation is impossible

International System is Anarchic

Peace: only happens when there's balance of power between states

## 6.2. [[Structural Realism\|Structural Realism]]

The structure of world politics is what makes cooperation unlikely

**Core Assumptions**

- International Structure: Anarchic, no supreme authority
- Focus more on structure rather than on human nature of Classical realists
- International cooperation possible, but fragile and not long lasting
- States care about relative gain only, not mutual

---

In [[Game Theory\|Game Theory]] , even with communication, one or both will try and betray the other to get relative gain

- Actors are given incentive to cheat
- Cooperation will sooner or later collapse

## 6.3. [[Rational Choice Theory\|Rational Choice Theory]]

States are rational actors

- Doing cost vs benefit analysis for decision makings

If the benefit of joining and IGO is better than the cost, they'll join the institution

## 6.4. [[Hegemonic Stability Theory\|Hegemonic Stability Theory]]

The world is only stable and peaceful when there is a world power looking over the international system.

- Creating public goods: international law, international institutions, standard of procedures
- Super power must take lead to make things possible

International cooperation is possible

Example: 

- Britain era of free trade in Europe
- US Bretton Wood international trade system, dollar standard, overseas investment

# 6.5. [[Social Constructivism\|Social Constructivism]]

The social world is created by human beings (war, peace, cooperation)

Emphasize role of idea, perception, identity

Process of How Pieces affect International System

- IGOs/International Laws can shape ideas
- in turn shaping states behaviors
- Shaping the international stage as a whole

Common Identity can be created to cooperate (UN, EU, ASEAN)

- To build relations
- Conduct diplomacy
- Strengthen unity/identity

# 7. [[Marxism\|Marxism]]

Criticizes the capitalist system, that it'll eventually lead to a revolution

Capitalist divide people into two groups

- Bourgeoisie: rich capitalists
- Proletariats: poor workers

Bourgeoisie exploits the workers (at the individual level)

## 7.1. [[Neo-Marxism\|Neo-Marxism]]

Use [[Karl Marx\|Karl Marx]] ideas at the global level

Pieces of global governance is funded by the rich states to be created.

Global Governance 

- only benefit rich states
- exploits poorer nations

Dependency Theory: Global Governance, created by rich states, to ensure poor states continue to depend on rich states

- Make sure the poor stays poor (economic independent)
- Make sure the rich stays rich

# 8. Organizational Interactions

Treats The world's international organizations as active members of international system

Why IOs are effective/ineffective by two groups of theories (Organizational Theory)

## 8.1. Inter-organizational Process

- Networks: IOs are effective when they have connections and interactions with more actors, IOs, NGOs
- Principle-agent interactions: The relation between member states and host IO determines whether or not decisions get passed or states are cooperative. If IO has autonomy or not.

## 8.2. Intra-Organizational Process

- Organizational Culture: values, rules, norms that can be made to strengthen decisions and cooperation in IO
- Organizational adaptation and learning: IO's ability to learn and change to adapt to the context of situation,
    - Norms and Focus changes through time
