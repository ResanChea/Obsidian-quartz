# Offensive Realism

- Offensive Realism is an idea Built on [[John Mearsheimer\|John Mearsheimer]] works along [[Structural Realism\|Structural Realism]] school of thought. In his book [[The Tragedy of Great Power Politics\|The Tragedy of Great Power Politics]]
    - John's assumptions combined together, the nature of the international system makes system act in an offensive way to gain hegemony for survival
    - Even knowing One power controlling the world isn't possible (hegemony), regional hegemons still are forced to try to get global hegemon (often failing)

# Offensive Realism
> [!example|right] ðŸ’¡ Ex: US became hegemon (19th century), Germany almost did in [[World War 1\|World War 1]]
- It argues that the anarchic international system encourages aggressive state behavior in international politics to secure own security
- having overwhelming power and dominating others is the best way to ensure oneâ€™s own survival
- great powers will always want more power to become the hegemony
    - Why do states gain power?
        - Global hegemony by one state isn't possible
        - States are encouraged to become regional hegemon in local area
        - And the area's regional hegemon becomes the "offshore balancer", to fill a power vacuum, prevent another state from being a regional hegemon in this region
- Attacker is often the winner of wars,
- attacker has lots to gain from exploiting the occupied, new information tech also help repression in many ways
    - attacker does not need to occupy the state (annex, divide, disarm)

# Three Types of Great Powers in Offensive Realism

- Continental Great Power (Napoleonic France): Hegemon aspirant.
- Island Great Power (Britain): Offshore balancer, preventing the rise of continental great power.
- Regional Hegemon (US): Maintain favorable status quo.

- Continental power doesn't have naval capability of Island Great Power who doesn't have the land capabilities of continental power (Russia & UK)

# In Comparison to [[Defensive Realism\|Defensive Realism]]

- Defensive Realism needs additional theories of foreign policy to explain un-strategic great power behaviors outside of structural realism theory (offensive realism doesn't need it)
- the past is better described by offensive realism
    - WW1, WW2, Imperial Germany, Imperial Japan, Nazi Germany...
    - Cold War
- Defensive realism says Weapons technology is defense dominant. Arms are meant to be used for defense
    - except railroads
    - Defensive realism failed to predict what happens so many times, WW1, WW2
    - Jack Snyder defends its faults
    - If weapons technology is Offensive dominant means the offensive has an advantage or defender must use offensive tactics for protection
- Coalitions are inefficient to balance â†’ vulnerable to attack
- Some state opt for **buck-passing**, letting other pick sides and stay in the side lines
