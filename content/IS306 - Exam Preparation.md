## 1. Controversial Issues in UN

- COVID-19
    - intellectual property of vaccine development
    - pharmaceutical secrets and commercialization of global pandemic
    - bilateral vs multilateral distribution of vaccines
        - bilateral improves countries' relations, but is unequal and bad for poor countries
            - If choose to use both, because it gives countries more methods in distributing vaccines
            - pragmatic: gives countries a chance to use opportunity to better relations with foreign partners
        - multilateral through COVAX is more equal but less self-beneficial to rich countries' foreign relations
            - stop countries from selectively choosing allies over the betterment of the collective world
            - COVAX is a trusted source that gaurentees contributions of vaccines safely gets to the hands of those who need it
            - COVAX doesn't discriminate who they pick to get the vaccines
    - investigation of China's source of COVID-19 (lab leak or natural)
- Somalia
    - How involved should the international community be in Somalia's instability
        - fighting between clans and the [[Islamic State\|Islamic State]]'s Al Shabaab
        - the resolution of internal political conflict either with the help of international intervention (US's position) or through internal discussion, void of outsiders' pressure (China's position)
            - Should US or international community be organizing an election for them or forcing it upon them?
- Myanmar
    - Between the people's want for democracy over the government's military dictatorship, which one should be prioritized when dealing on the international level?
    - putting an election ran by the un might be opposing western values on another country
    - Does sanctions, arms embargo, smart sanctions do anything to stop the ruler, or does it only hurt the citizens?
        - smart sanctions, asset freezes normally just hurts the people's finances
            - market activities that was once driven by the rich are less active leading to less wage for middle class
            - bad rulers or elites might confiscate and take from the poor for themselves
        - military sanctions if not done correctly or air tight will create a black market for weapon smugglers, underground deals, or distrust in the country

## 2. Reflection Questions

- Lessons learned about the United Nations
    - most countries abstain from voting and not pick sides to save face and maintain relations with both super powers
- Challenges of United Nations' system or procedure
    - the p5 being too overpowered / inequity of representation
    -  from p5, larger nations are represented by the same one vote as a tiny nation of insignificance
- Effectiveness of United Nations' role as the largest global intergovernmental organization
    - p5 being opposing superpowers leading to veto-off deadlock in decision making
        - disasters requiring immediate response makes the UN weak
        - becomes a playfield for superpowers to rally support for themselves and their decisions?
    - UN many times has turned to inaction such as the case of
        - The UN recognizing Khmer Rouge as representative of Cambodia while the country is in genocide.
        - Russia vetoed the decision to intervene in the on-going Syrian Civil War

## Notes of Interesting Things in UN Procedures

- States normally don't vote no on substantial matters to save face
    - if it doesn't sway the vote if you vote no or yes, just abstain
- Give case studies and substantial evidence to prove your points, not only using words
    - how could we do that in an exam, is that allowed to reference something obscure or should we reference a **well known event** instead.
