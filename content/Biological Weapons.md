# Biological Weapons

- **Biological Weapons**: spreading of virus or starting a pandemic in an enemy’s country as a Weapon of Mass Destruction ([[WMD\|WMD]])
    - Most believe biological weapons are too unpredictable to use as a reliable weapon
- **Uses of Biological Weapon**
    - strategic or tactical military applications
    - political assassination
    - the infection of livestock or agricultural produce to cause food shortages and economic loss
    - the creation of environmental catastrophes
    - the introduction of widespread illness, fear and mistrust among the public
- **Types of agents**
    - **Bacteria**: most lethal is anthrax. Easy to store, spread, stays a long time, non-contagious (easily contained)
    - **Virus**: smallpox is contagious, 30% lethality, leave survivor horribly scarred, vaccinations must available be in millions quickly to stop spread.
    - **Toxin**: are poisons produced by organisms, used to attack one person (Ricin is easily made by individuals)
- **Biological Weapons Convention**: Most states pledged to not develop, stockpile, or employ biological weapons in combat (1972)
    - Limitations: Codified everybody’s wants to rid of bio-weapons but isn’t legally binding
        - No verify compliance
        - Hard to verify because its very easy to make in small scales, pharma companies would need to open up to inspections → benefit competitors?
    - Solutions: To be more effective
        - Governments must have domestic laws against non-state actors in accordance with international law
        - A common regime must exist to secure pathogens in research and medical labs & define scientific codes of conduct
        - Increase international efforts to investigate suspicious disease outbreaks ([[COVID-19\|COVID-19]])
        - Require general global disease surveillance to monitor global ban of bio-weapons
- **Challenges posed by Biological Weapons**
    - Easily produced by non-state and terrorists without being detected and are highly lethal in small quantities
        - Experts doubt non-states can utilize it since state sponsored programs couldn’t
        - Hard to control and might affect terrorists’ own people
        - effectiveness relies on capabilities of public health service
    - Upcoming genetic engineering technology ([[CRISPR\|CRISPR]]) makes it easy to manipulate natural diseases and transform them into effective bio-weapons
        - Small research labs could make a bio-weapon
        - Governments can’t ban all labs in the country since all could make biological weapons
    - Inability to determine if a case was an attack or natural occurrence: they look exactly the same
- Case: Terrorists used anthrax in US
- Not viable inside real wars because it will spread back to own troops
