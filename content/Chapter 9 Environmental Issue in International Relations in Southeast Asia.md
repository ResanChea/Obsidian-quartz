ASEAN's pursuit of development payed little attention to environment degradation.

- Environmental concerns is new coming from the West
- Focus on Import-Led Industrialization
- Sees Environment concerns from the West as a economic jeopardize maneuver

# I. The Environmental Policy Setting

|1992: UN Conference to set universal framework for environmental issues in IR.

## |1992: Rio Declaration

Principles:

- Not impeding sovereignty
- States are responsible for their sustainable environment of their territory
- Prevent degradation of other states' environment

**Criticism:** from ASEAN and Asian states to compensate costs of stopping the use of natural resources.

ASEAN lied about complying with Rio Declaration

# II. The ASEAN Framework

|1977: ASEAN Expert Group of Environment, assisted by UNEP to look into environmental issues

- To this day, environmental issues still aren't taken that seriously

|1981: 1st AMM â‡’ Cebu Resolution on Sustainable Development to be enforced in 2006

- States along with nation development also need to take care of environment while doing so


ðŸ’¡ All ASEAN's declarations, resolutions, statements are in favor of Environmental Agenda.



## Problem of Enforcement

ASEAN does not have the capability or authority to demand it's members to implement environmental agendas.

- Actions comes from national interests and lack of political will of member states

# III. Deforestation


ðŸŒ² Deforestation cause 20% of greenhouse gas emission



ASEAN has 5% of global forrests

|But account for 25% of deforestation

## 1. The International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA)

as a legal framework for consultation and trade of forests

|Created: 1983

|Into Force: 1997

Failed to Implement

ASEAN states don't have laws in place to ban wood trading â‡’ voluntary enforcement

---

China imports 50% the world's timber

## 2. ASEAN States' Deforestation

States have lost their forests and turns to exploit neighbor's forests

- Philippines: 80% lost
- Vietnam: 51% lost
- Thailand

Indonesia: lost 72%, contribute to environment consequences


â›” ASEAN States declared against illegal logging but deforestation continue due to corruption



# IV. Haze

Smoke pollution caused by nature or man made

|1995: Adopted the Cooperation Plan on Transboundary Pollution

**Goal:** action program to prevent, monitor and mitigate haze

**Problem:** no enforcement measures

|1997: Most serious haze case

**Severity:** 226 ppm (Air Pollution Index)

- Lasted 7 months
- Costed $9 Billion
    - Cost of compensation for impacted victims
    - Closing of society and economy

|2002: ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution

- Indonesia rejected to ratify until 2014
    
    Demanded it must 
    
    - to include other problems
        - Illegal Fishing
        - Loggin
        - Toxic Waste Dumping
        - Sand Mining
    - Respect state sovereignty and no compensation for environmental damages

# V. The Maritime Zone

South China Sea's 2,500 water species depleted by over fishing.

- Disputed territory â‡’ Waste dumping

ASEAN-China gas and oil pipeline development without care of environment (trees)

## 1. Rivers, Dams, Ecosystems

Dams impacts:

- Change flood cycle
- Forests turn to reservoirs
- Village are displaced and fisheries disrupted â‡’ Human rights violation
- Natural processes of land, farm, fish, soil are changed

|1996: World Bank's World Commission on Dams

Showed negative impacts of dam building

States pursuing rapid economic growth ignored the report

### Damming the Mekong River

Past 6 countries

4800 km long

100+ dams build in Mekong River

- China plans to build more dams
- Cambodia, invested by Chinese, planned 14, and constructing 6

Dam Collapse in Laos caused suffering

# IV. Conclusion

|1997: ASEAN set for clear and green Southeast Asia by 2020

**Goal:** to implement mechanisms to protect environment

**Challenges:** didn't fulfil the vision

- Degradation of land
- Maritime environment
- Aggressive dams building
- Constrained by ASEAN Way
    - No enforcement measures
    - No regional cooperation or interest, only self-interest
