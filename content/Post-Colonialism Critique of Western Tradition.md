# Post-Colonialism: Critique of Western Tradition

### [[Post-Colonialism\|Post-Colonialism]]  accepts western traditions of

- the natural validity of western attempts and their scholars (Herodotus, Machiavelli, Kant)
- that Europe and the West responsible for spread of civilization

### Post-Colonialism rejects

- [[Immanuel Kant\|Immanuel Kant]]'s ideas for foundation of an international order, without recognition of Kant's gaps in representation of 18th century slavery
    
    Because
    
    - He lived when slavery was normal
    - He lived when three revolutions happened (in the US, France, and Haiti): one from slaves demand for freedom
    - 3 treatises on ‘love’ for humanity and moral sentiments cannot be true to slaves and former slaves

## Postcolonial critics want common society of the world (cosmopolitanism) but against method Europe use to try to make it.

What were European forms of colonial administrations for its colonies?

- protectorates (based on treaties of protection)
- indirect rule (dual control by a colonial administration and native rulers)
- direct rule (total administrative control)

Why did natives dislike European colonization and settlements?

- Protests against European forced insertion of political entities in treaties of concession and capitulation for colonies
- Europe built systems of international order, community, and/or society that is exploitative to colonies
    
    → Postcolonialism support revolts and revolutions by slaves and colonial populations against moral, legal, and cultural foundations of their enslavement created by the west
    

# Post-Colonialism has 3 conclusions to the **origins and how** [[Cosmopolitanism\|Cosmopolitanism]] ****can be attained

1. It's not enough for theorists to embrace categories of international order, international society, and international ethics as they are still political. 
    
    → They represent Europe as as the righteous teacher of others without context, purpose of engagement, and nature of behaviors.
    
2. Western universalism and moral philosophy fails to mention Western origination of modern forms of political violence, including [[Nazism\|Nazism]] , [[Fascism\|Fascism]] , Stalinism, total war
3. Western institutional narratives mistake desire of universalism as reality
    
    → unpredictable/dangerous actions disguised as liberation (invasion of Iraq) or humanitarian intervention (Somalia).
