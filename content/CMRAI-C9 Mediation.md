# Introduction

- Although there are many forms of mediation, in general, it is widely known for **“neutral” third-party assistance in reaching settlement**.
- Theoretically, an intermediary intervention in the negotiation process is not supposed to be authoritative in the sense that mediators do not make rulings or impose an agreement.
- Thus, mediation can be characterized as “a form of assisted negotiation” or at least is seen as “a catalyst for negotiation” (Touval and Zartman, 2001, p. 442).
- Being motivated for settlement is essential to any successful mediation not only because consent to a mediation process is voluntary but also because the disputants make final decisions on the issue.

# Attributes of Mediation

- In a classic definition, mediation is regarded as a process whereby a neutral third party, acceptable to all disputants, facilitates communication that enables parties to reach a negotiated settlement.
    - The assistance process helps the **parties arrive at an agreement voluntarily** without resorting to physical force, not invoking the authority of law.
    - The most important function of a mediator is the **creation of an atmosphere conducive for negotiation** by the facilitation of communication that leads to loosening tensions.
    - The third party would create good faith and confidence in reaching reasonable compromises by aiding their communication.
- An external agent utilizes their experience and expertise in contr**olling fear and reducing the stereotypes and prejudices** of the disputants in tandem with the supply of alternative and additional information.
- Parties are allowed to express their concerns and feelings directly or indirectly at meetings organized by mediators.
- An impartial third party ****has **no authoritative decision-making power** since the disputants are supposed to be the major players.
- Both the process and outcome should be acceptable to the participants in that mediation is based on consent.
    - In order to reach an agreement, intermediary activities may generally entail defining the areas of contention, making recommendations, and formulating mutually acceptable solutions, while endeavoring to open new possibilities.
- Given that mediation is not an institutionalized process (like arbitration or other forms of adjudication), in general, **formal rules or standard procedures do not exist**.

# Communication Links

- The major mediation function is the strategic adoption of skills to keep the communication flow balanced, fair, and productive (McCorkle and Reese, 2005).
- The most important task is to open contact, carry messages, and clarify meanings.
- A mediator’s job is to identify concerns that each party does not want to reveal openly.
- Part of communication activities is supported by the supply of missing information and the development of a rapport.
- The areas of agreement and disagreement can be discovered by open and sincere communication in a brainstorming process.
- Separate caucus sessions with each disputant are used in control or management of emotions.
- The chances of compromise are increased by more accurate assessment of each other’s positions.

# Motivations

- The adversaries should **believe that they need to rely on mutual cooperation** to satisfy their interests in tandem with the realization that coercive approaches produce only a backlash by nourishing further resentment and retaliation.
- Each party might feel the necessity for a joint decisionmaking process through facilitation after they experience a **deadlock derived from polarization in goals**, methods, values, and perceptions.
- In accepting mediation, each party may think that the **intermediary can help influence** the other party’s positions.
- **Higher expectations** about an outcome agreeable to both sides are more likely to lead to more serious talks.

# Roles and Functions of Intermediaries

- As mediation is a continuing means of negotiation, a mediator should have
    - communication skills
    - competence to manage adversarial relationships in order to reach an agreement
- As a channel of simple message delivery, a mediator might confine their role to the
    - interpretation and transmission of ideas.
    - In keeping negotiation going, a mediator can serve as a buffer as well as maintaining communication.
    - By transmitting information about possible needs and interests, a mediator assists partisans in expressing their concerns and identifying the specific needs that must be addressed.
- In general, mediator qualities are comprised of credibility (being trusted and respected) and empathy (related to both the feelings and ideas of the parties).
- A mediator develops rapport, meeting with the parties separately for a caucus.
- The communication function is geared toward helping the adversaries not lose face or look weak.

# Triadic Dynamics

- A triangular relationship is created by a **mediator’s role to bridge the two sides**.
- A mediator’s assumptions and **biases** as well as their own interests can result in favoring one of the parties.
    - The mediator’s impartiality is likely to be considered less important to the adversaries’ decision to **accept mediation** if it is not a matter of choice but **of necessity** (for instance, after military setbacks, etc.).
- Neutrality does not necessarily mean the maintenance of an unbiased position by a mediator on every issue if a mediator can bring an effective end to the fighting desired by all sides.
    - As long as a mediator is **believed to produce the outcome desired by all the parties**, some latitude of partiality is regarded as acceptable.
- A mediator can have more leverage if disputants have a high expectation about an outcome and are offered future financial or political support.
- In 1979, the US government pressed for the Egyptian and Israeli governments to accept a negotiated deal along with its promise to provide aid.
- A mediator may maintain leverage by employing such means as military aid, a UN vote, diplomatic support, better future relations, and an economic down payment.
- Powerful mediators have resources to withhold or prevent an outcome desirable for one of the parties.

# Diverse Modes of Mediation

- Reflecting on different degrees of intervention:
    1. mediation can be limited purely to the support of communication with a mediator serving as a **keeper of ground rules**.
        - In general, mediation (confined to communication support) generates low expectations about the outcome; **bringing parties to the negotiating table** itself becomes an important intermediary objective.
    2. Others may take more expanded roles by **suggesting alternatives** or getting **involved in content-related issues** beyond delivering proposals.
    3. The most active mediators are even willing to **guarantee the implementation of the agreement** (e.g., Israel–Egypt settlement) by putting their own resources on the table.
- The functions of **good offices** perform a channel of communication along with the interpretation and transmission of ideas.
- If their functions are limited to organizing meetings, keeping records, and providing clarity in communication, a third party is mostly concerned with a process of **identifying topics to be addressed** rather than shaping the actual content.
- Resolving highly intensive conflict can benefit from more active participation of an intermediary in the injection of new ideas about the nature and methods of ending hostilities.
- Mediators may make suggestions or offer advice about possible outcomes related to each party’s concerns even though the ideas for solutions can be generated by the parties.
- An effective mediator shares their ideas about the situations with the parties in identifying the areas of agreement.
- Alternative suggestions can be based on the discovery of each party’s bottom line.

## 1. From Less to More Directive Mediation

- In their most basic functions, mediators can be limited to passively transmitting ideas without any investment in the mediation’s outcome.
    - The less directive form of intervention is limited to message deliveries via shuttle diplomacy; chairing meetings or clarifying issues in formal mediation sessions.
- On the other extreme, **mediators can be highly directive with the authority to control and direct the actions of the parties** (although a directive mediator role still requires the cooperation of the parties).
    - More directive mediators may even decide acceptable settlement terms beyond generating and sharing information while changing the way parties interact.
    - In a muscle mediation designed to break an impasse, directive approaches involve a push for a particular option; a strong leverage by mediators and their allies helps more forceful mediation.
        - In **putting pressure on the parties** to accept a proposed settlement or make concessions, each mediator has a different leverage.
    - In a more directive approach, a full gamut of influence includes reward, persuasion, legitimacy, and information sharing as well as the threat of sanctions.

## 2. Intervention Strategies

- In order to induce cooperation, a mediator may utilize the strategies of persuasion, compensation, and pressure.
- In changing the perceptions of the parties, the effectiveness of persuasion depends on the appeal to the needs, tangible and intangible, to be satisfied.
- While reward can be made to compensate for concessions, it may be combined with forceful, pressing tactics.
- The threat of cessation of mediation may be adopted as a tactic to push for agreement when an intermediary feels frustrated with each party entrenched in their positions.
- The success of the mediator’s threat to quit depends on the fear of being blamed for scuttling the process.

## 3. Facilitative vs Evaluative Mediation

- **Facilitative mediation** stresses the informal and consensual nature of the process that is suitable for creative solutions.
    - A facilitator’s role is oriented toward process management rather than the substantive deal making.
    - Relationship management is necessary to enhance confidence and credibility along with reduction in hostility and tensions.
    - In carrying messages, mediators are gatekeepers for the flow of information.
    - Negative emotions and feelings tend to be controlled in the process of reframing the substance or facts of the message.
    - Trust and confidence of the disputants can be gained by avoiding taking sides.
- **Evaluative mediation**, an intermediary should be capable of making a judgment in assessing the disputants’ arguments about a fair deal.
    - Whereas principles, opinions, and values need to be separated from facts, a focus on the disputants’ **underlying interests or goals may still need to be regarded** as crucial to evaluative mediation.
    - In a domestic setting, retired judges, senior lawyers, or politicians are more likely to be respected when in charge of evaluative meetings due to the depth of their experience in a particular field (such as business contracts or wage disputes).
    - Evaluative mediators may bring about an end to interest-based conflicts more quickly and easily than adjudication.
    - Breakdown (in negotiation and mediation) means arbitration and going to court with great uncertainty.

## 4. Transformative Mediation

- Transformative mediation focuses on the improved relationships that help disputants develop their own capacity to resolve a number of disputes as they arise.
- The clarification of underlying issues and interests is essential to reframing and prioritizing the issues as well as clearing up assumptions.
- Trust and cooperation derive from the minimization of the effects of stereotypes through a communication process in mediation.
- Reduction in cognitive distortions contributes to the creation of a setting for mutual cooperation; empathy and sympathy can facilitate caring responses.
- Even though it can bring long-term positive relationships, transformative mediation is not easily adopted for crisis situations.

# Phases and Steps in Mediation

- There are diverse phases from initial contact to discussion of formal agreement.
- After the initial stage of contact, process functions can be set up to establish ground rules, clarify communication, define issues, and set agendas.
- At the opening stage, setting ground rules and structuring the agendas may move on to discussion about expectations.
- Keeping the process focused on the issues is essential to devising a framework to achieve an acceptable outcome.
- In shifting from the opening to proposal development stage, trust building can emerge from perceptional changes.
- At the stage of formulating and drafting proposals, mediators may remind the parties of the consequences of non-settlement and press the parties to be flexible along with supplying and filtering information.
- The formulation of viable options can be based on the assessment of what is minimally acceptable to each party.
- Less complicated issues can be resolved first in order to develop an atmosphere of accomplishment.
- That allows negotiation to continue until everyone is ready to accept the final draft as an agreement.
- The settlement can be formalized by establishing an evaluation and monitoring procedure along with the creation of an enforcement mechanism.

# Types of Mediators

- **State** versus **non-state intermediaries** can be compared in terms of their diverse motivations, skills, capacity, and leverage on disputing parties as well as differing values and principles.
- Various types of mediators have different degrees of leverage, ranging from the persuasion of alternative future and benefit to threat of withdrawal from their mediating efforts.
- **Individual states, alone or collectively**, may intervene in a conflict which adversely affects their political interests or as a way of enhancing their influence or status.
    - Strong states can apply carrot and stick to press for concessions, offer proposals, and alter the pay-offs and motivations.
    - On the contrary, small and middle-rank states are engaged in low profile strategies of dialogue and communication to improve their prestige and status.
- Mediation is often mandated or promoted by **international or regional organizations**.
- **Individual mediators** tend to be motivated by a desire to be instrumental in change.
    - Their initiatives heavily rely on a personal capacity with communication, facilitation strategies.
    - The involvement of individuals is not common and is limited to informal mediation prior to direct negotiations compared with a state’s involvement in mediation.
- In contrast with former politicians, **religious leaders** carry moral and persuasive ability.

# Coordination of Multiple Mediators

- Multiple types of mediators may join combined initiatives or develop separate contacts with contestants.
- The coordinated mediation initiatives can be sequentially executed upon the failure of previous ones.
- In a peace process, multiple activities can be complementary to supporting the entire process of negotiated settlement.
- Non-state mediators may open the door for formal negotiations involving state or other entities which have to carry out the agreement.
- In the absence of cooperation and consultation, new actors may take initiatives that contradict the existing process with a turf war in a crowded peace-making field (e.g., Burundi, Sudan, Somalia).

# Assessing Mediation

- In the simplest assessment, a mediation outcome is regarded as successful if it contains conflict and prevents armed clashes.
- A mediation outcome can be assessed in terms of either reaching an agreement or improvement in relationships that can pave a road for bilateral negotiations.
- The terms agreed in haste under pressure can be resented or overturned in the future.
- The feelings of equity felt by the parties as well as the mediator can motivate a durable change.
- The acceptance or rejection of settlement terms can be based on the consideration of its diverse consequences.

# Assessing Mediation

- Various mediators have different degrees of influence over the process and outcome, depending on the partisans’ relationships with the mediators.
- A more forceful mediator role can be beneficial, but it also has to involve strong incentives for the partisans to accept the dominant role of a mediator.
- If one of the parties clings to its position, it will be difficult to make a breakthrough.
- Good mediation is fair and efficient while improving the climate of the relationships.
- The success or failure of mediation represents not only internal but also external variables, ranging from the intervention timing to a shift in an international political environment.
- Beyond a mediator’s skills, effectiveness in mediation is also related to disputant motivation as well as each side’s internal power distribution and nature of their decision-making process.

# Ethical Issues & Power Imbalance

- Manipulative strategies (based on the presentation of erroneous facts and ambiguous statements) are not likely to produce genuine settlement, eventually tarnishing one’s reputation and credibility.
- In addition to procedural justice, substantive justice featured by a fair and equitable outcome should be one of the main criteria that guide the mediator’s judgments.
- At the same time, mediators will not avoid balancing ethical concerns and political feasibilities affected by power imbalance.
- One of a few tools possessed by mediators in the equalization of power is to let a marginalized party be aware of their own power as well as guaranteeing equal access to information.
- Yet, mediation is not easily adaptable to dealing with an unequal distribution of power established in social institutions.
- In general, mediators do not have authority and capacity to rectify conditions of injustice created by the disproportionate distribution of power and do not have a veto power over the outcome.
- Mediation may have to be conducted within a given political process which may not be suitable for serving the interests of marginalized parties.
- “The informality of mediation (when compared to litigation) may present inherent difficulties for weaker parties if the safeguards of more formal procedures are lacking” (Amy, 1987).
