# I. What is Regionalism

Group of countries with Geographical Proximity and mutual interdependence

## Causes

- Political Factors
    - Power Dynamic: shifts in the balance of power, coalitions, and regions form to deal with larger powers
        
        Indonesia's Leadership of SEA by Sukano
        
    - Identity: anti-communistic, not democratic, authoritarianism in different ways (ASEAN value)
    - Ideology: ASEAN Way, wants centrality role for ASEAN
    - Political System: diversity of different authoritarianism states
    - Shared external and internal threats
- Economic Factor: regionalism improves trust and interdependence between states
    - ASEAN's current economies are not interdependence
    - Desire to be interdependent, ⇒ grow bigger
    - regional cooperation ⇒ maximize national interest
    - Don't want interdependence to compromise sovereignty

# II. ASEAN Current Day

- Indonesia remains in the leadership role
    
    no states compete Indonesia for leadership
    
    - Indonesia's larger geography, population, economy
    - Other states rely on Indonesia more than Indonesia rely on others/
- ASEAN Survived the Cold War: Indochina
- ASEAN's noncontentious approach: not to bring up sensitive domestic issues of other countries ⇒ no institutional authority or coercive power
- ASEAN acts as the bigger body to negotiate internationally (but members have different national goals)

## Expansion of Membership

Decreases ASEAN cohesion

- Cambodia & Laos: China used to stop collective decision makings on the South China Sea Dispute. (2012, Cambodia)
- Singapore's Initiative for ASEAN Integration was flawed intergrational plan: lacking mechanisms to make happen

# ASEAN Initial Evolution

- Member states only met after a decade after ASEAN creation (to combat spread of communism): members don't value ASEAN
- The secretariat has no power, only office, and meeting coordinator
- ASEAN unilateralism initiatives
    - ASC and AEC were to annouced in 2020, but Thailand and Singapore insisted for it to be annouced in 2015 instead
    - When faced with big challenges, members switch to unilateralism and seek external help rather than rely on ASEA

## ASEAN Charter

Adopted in Cebu, the Philippines 2007

- Noninterferance
- Peaceful settlements
- Prohibition of threat and other violent ways
- Self determination, no external coercions.
- Mutual respect for each states' soverignty equality, territorial integrity, and national identity of all nations.

# Conclusion

ASEAN has not fulfiled it's objectives

- Lack will to compromise soverignty for better ASEAN
- "Old wine in new bottle" says that ASEAN uses the same system even if its flawed
- Weak interdependence
