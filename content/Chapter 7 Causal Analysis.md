# Quick Notes

3 causal mechanisms

- Time Ordering
- Association
- Non-spurious Association

# 1. Causal Models

Two Causal approach

- Nomothethic approach
- Idiographic approach

## 1.1. Nomothetic

a general approach that seeks the common factors responsible for events in a research

- More general questions or factors
    - What causes suicide?
- Level: Macro
- Explanations: Probabilistic, a guess, not definite answer
- Data: Quantitative (Deductive)

## 1.2. Idiographic

Seeks to find specific factors of the specific event.

- Question: Specific
- Levels: Micro, looking at specific one or few subject rather than a large group
- Explanation: Deterministic, find exact reason and cause
- Data: Qualitative (Inductive, Survey)

A morel limited scope 

- What caused Robin to take his own life?

# 2. Nomothetic Approach

To study how one variable affect another variable

Must have 3 Requirements

## 2.1. Temporal Ordering (time ordering)

Independent variable must be before dependent variable in time

A happens before B, then A is the cause of B

## 2.2. Association Between Variables

Two variables picked for research must be related in some way

A $\leftrightarrows$ B

association doesn't imply cause, 

but to cause one another, the two must be associated

## 2.3. Non-Spurious Association

We need to pick variables that are directly affecting each other, not through a third party variable.

Spurious: two variable is connected through a third variable. the 'independent variable isn't directly leading to the dependent variable

A → B ← C → A

A $\nrightarrow$ C

To control C$_{\tiny{(s)}}$

- Analyze C's separation to see if it's the cause of change in dependent variable
- If A still → B, then A & B survive spurious test

The sea of C$_{\tiny{(s)}}$: science effort is to control C or eliminate C in the causal model.

# 3. Causal Analysis in Different Research Designs

## 3.1. Experimental Design

To document effects of independent and dependent variables Research where researchers:

- Experimental Group: exposed to the independent variable
- Control Group: not exposed to the independent variable
- [[Random Assignment\|Random Assignment]]: equal chance to end up in control group or experimental group.

Experimental Design has very strong internal validity

Example: The causal connection between using nicotine patch (Cause) and subsequent changes in smoking behaviors (effects)

- Set up control and experimental group through random assignment
- Expose experimental group to independent variable

## 3.1.1. Threat to Internal Validity

What makes a research internally invalid. These can be eliminated by the use of an experiemental design

- History: some large event that could affect subject rather than from the independent variable
- Maturation: when subjects has changed through time influencing dependent variable
- Selection Bias: when Random Assignment isn't implemented. Subjects are picked in favor for research

## 3.1.2. The Limits of Experimental Design

- Uncontrollable Variables: some variables cannot be controlled by the researchers
    - fixed variables: variables attached to subjects **since birth (early in life)**. Cannot be manipulated (gender, race...)
- Non-Ethical Experiment: researchers might create ethical and political issues for conducting the research
- Weak External Validity: findings might not apply in real life society instead of a lab
    - it lacks mundane realism

## 3.2. Causal Analysis via Non-experimental Survey Research

causal analysis typically through cross-sectional design: data collect at one point in time

### 3.2.1. Method/Process

- time-ordering:
    - **Fixed variable** as independent variable, which doesn't change no matter when the data was collected. Since birth
    - Include retrospective questions in questionnairs: questions about the past, unchanging
- non-spurious: Include all possible C variables in the survey
    
    **How would you solve non-spurious by including Cs in survey?**
    
    Look at theory, the connection between variables, which connects to Cs
    
    - Make C variables the same for all subjects from both control group and experimental group
- association: use statistical test to control C in analysis
    
    Do literature review
    
    - to see all Cs
    - to review past independent/dependent variables

---

Survey is used for qualitative questions, but there are weaknesses

- Surveys don't use experimental design
- Do not manipulate independent variables
- Surveys are not as controlled as an experiment
- If survey delivered to the potential respondents.

## 3.3. Causalty and Field Research

Data of causal analysis are words & images, need to respect causal mechanisms

- description/Explorative
- correlational analysis
- exploration or evaluation
- process or change

Analyze to provide 'thick description' in order to narrate to specify causal mechanism, contextualize to see which event happened first

## Field Research

To pursue causal analysis

## Idiographic Model

Weakness

- Narrative: to put the story in order, Different individual observing the same event will have different outcome or result
- Constructing an argument doesn't mean it's correct
