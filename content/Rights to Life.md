The work of the International Criminal Tribunals:

What are the main points mentioned in the following sections?

-       Rwanda, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (Page 15) Vachana, Vatey

Much of the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda has been on genocide. To date, forty-seven cases have been completed and seven individuals have already completed their sentences. Charges have included genocide and crimes against humanity. Jean-Paul Akayesu was the first-ever individual convicted of genocide by an international tribunal. He was found guilty of nine counts of his indictment and sentenced to life imprisonment (his sentences, ranging from ten years to life run concurrently) (Prosecutor v Akayesu). This case was the first international interpretation and application of the Genocide Convention—the Trial Chamber concluded that rape and sexual violence were capable of constituting genocide if committed with intent to destroy the targeted group. Later, the Tribunal convicted Jean Kambanda, the former Rwandan prime minister, of genocide and crimes against humanity. He pleaded guilty at first instance and was convicted in 1998; his appeal (at The Hague) was unsuccessful with the convictions and sentence of life imprisonment standing. He is the first head of government to be convicted of genocide (Prosecutor v Kambanda). Other judgments have involved a prime minister, government ministers, and bourgmestres among those in authority as well as various religious leaders. The role of the media has also been examined with three persons convicted at first instance on counts relating to genocide despite not being physically involved (Nahimana and ors). A completion strategy has been prepared as, by definition, the Tribunal’s role in Rwanda is finite, appeals are, however, continuing in The Hague.

  

-       International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) (Page 15) Resan, Lychhing

People with serious violations of international humanitarian law in Former Yugoslavia from 1991 which convicted more than  60 people. The Celebici helped convict people of genocide rather than just murder. The former president of Yugoslavia was terminated by his death in 2006, he was also indicted on a number of account related to the right to life, including genocide. Radovan Karadzic was found in Serbia and remanded to the Hague for trial in 2008. Though the Muslim in Bosinia make up only a small portion of the population they suffer a lot. The massacare murder many military age men, even the one who are non combatant were also kill as well. The Galic, Bosnian-Serb army commander were sentence to life imprisonment for the acts of violence and spreading terror among civilian of Sarajevo.

The International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals was established by the Security Council through the adoption of resolution 1966 (2010) of 22 December 2010, to finish the work begun by The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and ICTR (The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda). It consists of two branches corresponding to the two tribunals. The ICTR branch, located in Arusha, Tanzania, commenced functioning on 1 July 2012. The ICTY branch is located in The Hague and commenced functioning on 1 July 2013.
