1. Before we even start to consider the rollout of 5G, however, 4G networks today are still vulnerable to a myriad of attack modes, from spam to
    - eavesdropping
    - malware
    - IP-spoofing
    - data and service theft
    - DDoS attacks
    - 4G is still rolling out in Asia Pacific and still have many issues that need to be addressed first
        - unsecured IoT systems, could be amplified exponentially under 5G if not addressed at 4G
2. There's not enough talents in cybersecurity protection
    - Let automation do the menial tasks
    - Find people who have skill sets that cannot be automated and focus on higher-order tasks, such as problem-solving, communication and collaboration
    - Look for talent in better places: not just cyber security trained people but do upskill and cross-skill

1. IoTs because of lazy manufacturing and short period software/security support leads to devices vulnerable to DDOS attacks
    - Asia pacific develop 36% of the world's IOT devices
    - deepfakes taking over phone, door bell face identification
    - enterprises: manufacturing industries want to use sensors, trackers, wearables, gps to streamline their manufacturing process with the system connected devices
        - They need to invest in security of these connected devices with diagnostic software and hardware
    - asian states must issue guidance and restrictions on companies' IoT practices
2. Personal data privacy of internet users are bad cuz
    - Companies use users data to be sold without the people knowing what they're used for
    - People are ignorant of how they give out their data such as in websites, apps, and scam forms
    - People underestimate the danger of giving out personal data

    - APEC voluntary agreement to allow free flow of personal information across borders while protecting private and risky information to allow harmonization and benefits each other internationally in asia
        - but its voluntary and does not harmonize
