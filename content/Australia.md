# Australia

## Demographic of Australia

- 3.5 million older Australians in 2015 [^3]
	- representing 1/7 people
	- 15.1% of the population in which this proportion has increased from 14.3% in 2012.

## Health in Australia

- 22% of people have a long term health condition [^1]

## Disability in Australia

- 1/6 of Australians have disability [^1]
	- 1/3 of the disabled have severe disability (1.4M)
	- 1/4 of the disabled is mental or behaviorally disabled
	- Why are there so many with disability?
		- Disability rates correlate with age, as Australia's population grows older, like [[Japan\|Japan]], disability goes up
		- Although disability rates in Australia is going down for elders, they still are higher than younger people
	- How does this disability rate compare to Cambodia and the rest of the world?

- 4.4M with disability [^2]
	- Only 500k with National Disability Insurance Scheme
	- NDIS says it only supports those with severe disabilities

- The disabled is [[Discrimination\|discriminated]] against
	- Unequal job opportunity: lower wage, not provide appropriate help in workplace for disability
	- High rate of arrest/imprisonment

## Indigenous Groups

- The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders of [[Australia\|Australia]]
- Issues of 
	- The *Stolen Generation*: white people stole aboriginal decendents in the intention of integrating them into white society in the 19-20th century [^6]
		- for them to work
		- thinking that as the aboriginal population was low, there was not way they could still exist in full blood aboriginals anyways
	- Lower quality of life in general

### [[Discrimination\|Discrimination]]

- As of September 2019, [Aboriginal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Australian "Aboriginal Australian") and [Torres Strait Islander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander "Torres Strait Islander") prisoners represented 28% of the total adult prisoner population [^5]
- while accounting for 2% of the general adult population (3.3% of the total population).
- Reasons for over-representation in criminal system
	1. Socio-economic disadvantage, [substance use disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder "Substance use disorder"), [homelessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness "Homelessness") and overcrowding, lack of education and [physical and mental health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians%27_health "Indigenous Australians' health") issues
	2. Structural bias and discriminatory justice system: failure to know cultural differences. Not knowing the existance of laws which discriminate (directly/indirectly) against these groups.

### Closing the Gap Strategy
- Closing the Gap Strategy: created by the federal government in 2008 to improve the lives of indigenous peoples in these fields:
	- To close the life expectancy gap within a generation
	- To halve the gap in mortality rates for Indigenous children under five within a decade
	- To ensure access to early childhood education for all Indigenous four-year olds in remote communities within five years
	- To halve the gap in reading, writing and numeracy achievements for children within a decade
	- To halve the gap for Indigenous students in year 12 attainment rates by 2020
	- To halve the gap in employment outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians within a decade

- Effectiveness [^4]
	- Only 2 goals were on track to be met in 2020
	- It was set up to fail, it didn't work with the group its trying it help, it was a top-down approach, managed by the bureaucrats
	- *Closing the Gap* is being reworked to involve aboriginals and Torres Islander Peoples to set the targets themselves rather than set it for them (2020)
		- [[If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day\|If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day]]
		- Government says its changing, but its not.
	- How to make it succeed?
		- when it supports greater community control at a local level
		- puts more focus on strategies to build community resources for health and wellbeing

## Refugees and asylum seekers in Australia

- Australia is part of the *Refugees Convention* of the UN, meaning people who fit the definition of refugees [^7]
	- Must not be sent back to their country where their life and freedom will be threatened (principle of non-refoulment)
	- Must not send non-refugees to countries where their human rights are threatened
	- Must protect the human rights of them, with or without visa
		- Include rights to not be arbitrarily detained
	- Provide for needs of asylum seekers and refugees: torture and trauma counseling, access to family tracing services, access to legal and migration advice, interpreting and translation, health and mental health care, and access to education and recreational activities.

- Processing asylum seekers in Australia [^7]
	- If the person satisfies health, identity, and security requirements, they'll be given a visa
	- Non-refugees who face human rights threats in their origin country, if they meet the *complementary protection criteria* (ICCPR, CAT, or CRC)
		- If a non-refugee is owed complementary protection, satisfies health, identity, and scurity requirements, they will be given visa
	- Those refused can: 
		- seek independent merits review by Refugee Review Tribunal
			- or Administrative Appeal Tribunal. 
		- Or ministerial intervention to allow to remain under humanitarian or compassionate grounds
