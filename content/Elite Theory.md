**Elite theory**: Elite theory developed in contrast to [[Marxism\|Marxism]] class theory and was associated mainly with 

- the **German sociologist** Robert Michels (1876-1936)
- two **Italian political sociologists** - Gaetano Mosca (1858-1941) and Vilfredo Pareto (1848-). 1923).

Both elite and Class Theory argue that **politics is dominated by a small population**.

- The different between elite and class theory:
    - Marxists claim that ruling elite or ruling class continue ruling for the next generation by transferring its privileges and powers to their children
    - elite theory claims that elites could not sustain themselves in the long run.
- Elites change and circulate to be replaced by a new, more successful and stronger elite because elites inevitably less effective after being in power for a particular period of time.
- New elites rise the top because of their outstanding political skills of tricking people, force or popular appeals.
- Every version of elite theory claim that mass democracy is impossible is because a small group will always dominate politics.
    - Example: Similarly, C. Wright Mills (1916–62), argues that the USA is run by a small group of people representing the
        - ‘military–industrial complex’ and consisting of military leaders (the warlords)
        - top businessmen (the corporate directorate)
        - political leaders
    - They have the same middle- and upper-class background and they think and act the same way. They make all the 'key decision' in the USA, although less important decisions may be made by middle levels of power in a more or less democratic manner.
