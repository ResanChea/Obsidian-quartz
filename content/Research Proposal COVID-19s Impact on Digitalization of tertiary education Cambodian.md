- Past actions to deal with covid 19 for education sector

Research Problem

From the issue of the global pandemic, COVID-19 has brought many challenges towards the world globally. As for Cambodia, specifically the education sector, the situation is quite controversial to look at. Ever since March 2020, the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports had announced for school closing of all level of education. It was not up until October that some schools were allowed to re-open. Unfortunately, just a few days ago, the community break out has scared many, leading to the ministry, announcing for another 2 weeks suspension of all level of education except for 12th grade in high school. 
Taking a look at university level, collage students are now adapting to digital learning via online platforms and webinar such as Zoom, Microsoft Team and Google Meet. Although this shift of learning style is drastically fast and different, many students are now left with no choice but to quickly adapt to it. Clearly in IFL, Department of International Studies, students have completed 1 semester online and starting off a new semester on the same platform.

Research Problem

1. What is the most preferred learning method by college students between physical and digital learning?
    
    Hypothesis 1: Physical learning is the most preferred learning method by college students between physical and digital learning.
    
    Hypothesis 2: Digital learning is the most preferred learning method by college students between physical and digital learning
    

1. How accessible are the learning materials through digital platform on the tertiary level?
    
    Hypothesis 1: Learning through the digital platform on the tertiary level is very accessible.
    
    Hypothesis 2: Learning through the digital platform on the tertiary level is not very accessible.
    
2. Have the outcomes of learning through digitalization improved compared to physical learning in universities?
    
    Hypothesis 1: The outcome of learning through digitalization has improved compared to physical learning in universities.
    
    Hypothesis 2: The outcome of learning through digitalization has worsened compared to physical learning in universities

A research on Universities in countries (including Cambodia), how they adapted their website, app, and information sharing during COVID-19

The novel Coronavirus is relatively new. Therefore, the literature and research on the topic in Cambodia is limited, especially ones addressing digital education in the country specifically. The Journal of Social Sciences by Scientific Research Publishing took on a study of this topic on a broader scale. The study focused on the virus's impact on developing countries' education sector. The paper found that most of the world shutdown their schooling system and replaced it with digital system of education. This created problems of accessibility, technological illiteracy, and equality for families in dealing with digital education, especially in the country side. Therefore, this research paper will explore how the switch to digital education has affected Cambodian university students as well as the Cambodian education sector as a whole. [(Scientific Research Publishing, 2020)](https://www.scirp.org/pdf/jss_2020102315145995.pdf). 

From a research published in May 2020, titled 'Academic Institutions at the Time of COVID-19 Pandemic', addressed the accessibility of COVID-19 information on universities' websites of 14 different countries. [(IJSR, 2020)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dinesh_Bhuju2/publication/341188849_Academic_Institutions_at_the_Time_of_COVID-19_Pandemic/links/5ecf757a299bf1c67d23dd36/Academic-Institutions-at-the-Time-of-COVID-19-Pandemic.pdf). From each country, including Cambodia, 5 universities were picked to be examined. The institutions were checked on whether they displayed information regarding COVID-19 awareness on their webpage. Out of the five universities picked for Cambodia, only one had information regarding COVID-19 and emergency contacts. The study focused on the variable of universities' websites to determine universities' role in spreading COVID-19 information.

CAN ICT HELP CAMBODIAN STUDENTS BECOME THE SOLUTION FOR IMPROVING EDUCATION IN THE COUNTRY?

A recent study was conducted in 2019 named 'Can ICT help Cambodian students become the solution for improving education in the country?'. The study brought up one of 'the seven principles of learning, where effective learning must be from 'cooperative group learning that is well organized and challenging'. Cambodian college school system should have the standard practice of practical learning, where students are teach other students to apply their knowledge, either face to face or digitally. Public high school students could also learn from college students presentations.

Currently there lack a critical understanding of the proper methodology in implementing or utilizing a fully digital education system. There are few research that delve into the nitty gritty of a university system where all forms of teaching and learning is conducted virtually, either through the face-to-face method of video-calling or through pre-recorded lectures and pre-written materials. This is not to mention digital education's role in the developing country of Cambodia, as it possess even less data and analysis on this certain topic.

A 2010 study named 'Exploring a new learning landscape in tertiary education' found that students are increasingly integrated technologies into their learning. These new learners, coming into the tertiary education level, utilizes a wide range of digital technology. However, they still require more guidance in dealing with critical comprehension that technology cannot be of much help. On the other side, the study also found that teachers tend to underutilize digital technology in managing the classroom, the use of online resources for students, and normally are resistant to changes from the traditional face to face education process that teachers were used to. [(NLW, 2010)](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1108/03074801111136266) 

In the 2019 paper named 'Student Perception of Digital Technology Usage in Higher Education Classrooms at Seattle Pacific University', only a minimal fraction of students desired heavy integration of technology in their school curriculum. Furthermore, only 7% of students preferred an all digital course for their major. 

The study from the University of Chicago Press was published in 2011 discussing the challenges of adopting new technology for education in lesser developed countries, while focusing on the case of Cambodia. The study used the Roger's model, which divided the characteristics of an invention that impact the likelihood of adoption of that certain innovation. The study found several problems with Cambodia adoption of digital education in 2011. First, the lackluster quality of computers available, the limited knowledge of usage and repair skills hindered the adoption of computers. Second is that electricity outages destroyed teachers works leading to frustration. In addition, the lack of computer units led teachers to not gain practice or produce reliable results from them. Third, the issue of trialability, meaning ability of users to test out the product to see its value, is not there due to the lack of computer units, electricity outages, and the knowledge required to operate. Therefore, computers in schools are usually in disrepair and overlooked for more 'convenient' alternatives. [(Jayson W. Richardson, 2011)](https://scihub.wikicn.top/10.1086/656430).

## Conceptual Framework

In the time of crisis, such as the on going COVID-19 pandemic, much processes in society is switched to digital. With the aim to study the new emergence of digital aspect of every field in society, digital education must also be considered upon it's potential and viability as compared to the traditional face-to-face teaching. In order to achieve this, this paper aims to collect data from IFL university students in Phnom Penh. University students are evaluated upon their experience in adapting to the new method of studying and their opinion on the benefits of an all digital tertiary system of teaching. 

In the process of analyzing students' experiences with digital education we can then comprehend the 

Many research point to the same conclusion that learning technologies imported from developed countries might not work for developing countries such as Cambodia for several reasons. The economic cost required for each student's studying, the cost and accessibility of critical resources such as internet access, and accessibility of physical infrastructure of electricity [(Sharma, RC)](http://libgen.gs/scimag/ads.php?doi=10.1109/itre.2003.1270670). Therefore, jumping the gun on adopting new learning technology for the sake of keeping up will not be effective.
