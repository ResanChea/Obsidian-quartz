# Positivism [^1]

- Involved in Fourth Great Debate of the [[The Four Great Debates in IR\|The Four Great Debates in IR]] [^2]

### What is Positivism?

**Positivist**: information derived from **sensory experience**, as interpreted through reason and logic, forms the exclusive source of all certain knowledge.

- strictly uses the scientific approach use of data, research, statistics to determine IR (Objective answer). [^3]
- Rejects claim without empirical evidence to prove the theory. Most follow scientific methods
- follows empiricism
- any knowledge is fallable. New discoveries could disprove past findings.
- Contradicts:: [[Post-Positivism\|Post-Positivism]]

### What does Positivists base their knowledge claims on? Is it reliable?

**foundationalism** a term used to describe theories that believe that our knowledge can have foundations, either in reason and rationality, systematic empirical observation, or independent existence of reality.

- **Dominance of rationalist** approach on 'how we knows what we knows' through foundationalism
    - It makes knowledge claims based on secure grounds
    - Rationalists claim it is more accurate as it uses **systematic scientific approach.**
    - Humans can gain knowledge by science and objective truths rather than theory and facts.

### 3 Founding Assumptions of Positivism

- **epistemic realism**: there is an external world independent of what the observer does
- **universal scientific language**: the external world can be described in language without guessing anything and is detached from observers' biases.
- **correspondence theory of truth**: observer can determine if anything in true or false statements

>[!quote] ‘approach political reality with a kind of rational outline’ and distinguish ‘between **what is true objectively and rationally**, **supported by evidence and illuminated by reason**, and **what is only a subjective judgement**, divorced from the facts as they are and informed by prejudice and wishful thinking’
>-- [[Hans Morgenthau\|Hans Morgenthau]]
> 

### **Approach**

- The Objective approach to use scientific data, research, and facts to determine one objective answer
- Subjects: Mathematics, Economics
- Method: Hypothesis, Collection of data for research
- Focus on Explaining using samples
- Theory does not apply to theorist

- supports:: [[Realism\|Realism]]
