# Terms

$Inflation$: price of goods & services increase while value of money falls $P\uparrow \ \$\downarrow$

$Deflation$: price of goods & services decrease while value of money increase $P\downarrow\$\uparrow$

- Value of Money: the equivalent of goods & services the money could be exchanged for
- Money Demand: the context of society determine demand and value of medium of exchange

# The Value of Money

- Price Level: calculated through CPI and GDP Deflator
- Price Level ($1/P$): the value of $1 measured in goods it can buy

# Money Supply

Who determine and affect money supply

- Central Bank\Fed: take actions to precisely control the MS
- Private Banks & Citizen

# Money Demand

How much wealth people wants to hold in liquid form, not bonds, properties...

- Money Demand negatively related to Value of Money
- Money Demand positively related to Price of Goods & Services

# Real vs. Nominal Variables

**Nominal Variables:** values measured in money

W = nominal wage = price of labor (15$/hour)

P = price level = price of g&s ($5/unit of output)

**Real Variables:** measured in physical units

- How much it's valued through its equivalent value of another good/service
- A fixed value represented through monetary units

$Real\ Interest\ Rate=Nominal\ Interest\ Rate-Inflation\ Rate$

$Real Wage=\frac{W}{P}=\frac{\$15/hour}{\$5/unit\ of\ output}=3\ units\ output\ per\ hour$

- Relative Price: the price of one good relative to another
    
    $Good1\ Relative\ Price =\large\frac{Good1}{Good2}$
    

# The Neutrality of Money

Monetary Neutrality: propose that changes in the money supply don't affect real variables in the long run

$\Large \frac{Good1}{Good2}=\frac{2\times Good1}{2\times Good2}$

# The Velocity of Money

Velocity (V): The rate at which money changes hand in the economy

$\begin{aligned}
P \times Y = nominal GDP &= (price\ level) \times (real\ GDP) 
\\ M &= money supply 
\\ V &= velocity
\end{aligned}$

$Velocity\ Formula: V=\frac{P\times Y}{M} \newline M\times V=P\times Y$

Nom=500

P=10

M=100

Real=Nom/P=500/10=50

v=PxReal/M=10x50/100=5

# The Quantity Theory

$M\times V=P\times Y$

1. V is stable over the long period of time
2. Y is not affected by changes in M

$2008:V=\frac{P\times Y}{M}=\frac{5\times 800}{2000}=2$

$\begin{alignedat}{2}
2009: &P\times Y = V\times &M = 2\times 2100 = \$ 4200\\
&5\% &5\%
\end{alignedat}$

$Inflation=\frac{P_{2009}-P_{2008}}{P_{2008}}=\frac{5.25-5}{5}=5\%$ 

$Inflation=\frac{P^{2009}-P_{2008}}{P_{2008}}=\frac{5.25-5}{5}=5\%$

- Inflation Tax: when tax revenue is not enough, so government print more money â‡’ hyperinflation

# The Fisher Effect

$$
Nominal\ Interest\ Rate=Inflation\ Rate+Real\ Interest\ Rate
$$

Nominal Interest Rate can be changed by the government

# The Cost of Inflation

- The Shoe-leather-cost: people put money in banks for interests to counter inflation. The cost of time and transactions cost not worth giving up
- Menu Cost: the cost of changing the price tags constantly
- Misallocation of resources from relative-price variability: firms don't change prices at the same time, relative price varies
- Cause confusion of the changing prices
- Tax Distortion: nominal income grows faster than real income
    - Income After Tax = Income - Tax

## A Special Cost of Unexpected Inflation

- Arbitrary Redistributions of Wealth: the repaying of debts while the value of currency is low
    
    Higher than expected inflation
    
    - Lender: loser | Borrower: winner
    
    Lower than expected
    
    - Lender: winner | Borrower: loser
