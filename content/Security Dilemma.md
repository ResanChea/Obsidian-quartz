# Security Dilemma [^1]

- Is a concept from [[Structural Realism\|Structural Realism]], where [[Kenneth Waltz\|Kenneth Waltz]] says **states must increase power to gain security**
    - But end it ends up making other states less secure
- Security Dilemma is the difficult choice states have to make between choosing to continue building their power and stopping.
- As the International System being anarchic the structure forces states to build power or become extinct. However, no matter the choice, it always end in war.
- States A cannot stay in one place or risk being invaded by state B who builds up their power.
    - State B will take an opportunity to take out their enemy (State A)
- No matter what you choose to do you will be end with the bad result of War
    - That's why its a dilemma

## Small States

- Small States are more vulnerable in the Anarchical international system
- Due to their inferior capabilities to produce security solely through internal measures
    - Small states canâ€™t increase their security through their own actions
    - They get security through larger powers: either balancing, neutrality, alliance, or [[Shelter Theory\|Shelter Theory]]
- Structure of IS is the main factor, not what small states do themselves
- Therefore, according to Waltz, small states must
    - bandwagon with great powers
    - Balancing: build alliance with smaller states
