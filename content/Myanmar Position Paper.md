# Self-Note

Be realistic about your country's actions

Shallow actions have deeper meanings

- ineffective sanctions are just to save face

If Russia veto something China also wants to veto first, then China doesn't need to show it's true position

Beware of media warfare

- No media is neutral
- Issue concerning country of publisher will be biased in coverage
- Look at multiple news sites from multiple parties involved

Play it safe, pick less polarizing resolutions

# Background

[Myanmar coup latest: Junta seeks democracy 'within a year'](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Myanmar-Coup/Myanmar-coup-latest-Junta-seeks-democracy-within-a-year)

The country of Burma, through its troublesome journey to democracy, has faced yet another challenge during recent years. An election was held late 2020 resulting in the National League for Democracy's landslide victory. However, the military junta, officially named 'Tatmadaw', pronounced the election invalid without proof and conducted a coup on February 1$^\textsf{st}$ . Not only were the legitimately elected politicians barred from power but they were also unjustly imprisoned. A one year long state-of-emergency was established and the military promise an election once it is over. With that, protests erupted against the military's actions resulting in hundreds killed and thousands more injured due to harsh crackdowns from the military. Alongside this, the long standing civil conflict between ethnic minorities militias and the Tatmadaw continues while violent protest against the coup added to this flame. Burma has been on the decline economically as well, as distrust in the government depreciates its currency while foreign investors withdraw their businesses. 

The United States of America seek for the troublesome conflicts in the country to stop, for stability to take place, and the civil unrest to be addressed. With the help from the United Nations and its associated organizations to provide both humanitarian aid as well as guidance in managing the situation within the country of Burma.
