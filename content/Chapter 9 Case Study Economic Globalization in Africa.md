# Case Study: Economic Globalization in Africa

the benefits of globalization is not equally distributed.

- Africa lacks behind in almost every aspect

there are positive signs in Africa economies though:

- They erased their debts to the IMF
- Received China's aid and investments without preconditions
- < $\frac{2}{3}$have some form of democratic elections

attempts to mobilize capital must be domestic, external aid should serve as a compliment to Africa's own efforts, and better governance is essential for positive changes in Africa to occur.

# 1. An Evolving Global Economy

4 Major Economic Systems

- Soviet Union Socialist model
- The US liberalm arket ecoomy
- The imperial preference system of European
- Mercantilist Statist

Countries were mostly closed, without much IOs to help with trade

How global economy adapted to expanding globalization.

# 2. The Globalization of Liberal Economy Norms

Adam Smith: humans are selfish beings, for self-interests only. Market economy supply and demand will keep price low.

- Market without interference from institutions or governments will benefit and improve
- Less developed countries must borrow loans to kick start economy
- Bretton Woods institutions wanted to bridge the financial gap between rich and poor states

## The Bretton Wood Institution

World Bank and IMF aid countries with economic issues

The Washington Consensus became new model (Bretton Wood Consensus)

- Helping the poor: prove basic healthcare, infrastructures etc.

Why did they doubt the Bretton Wood System?

## The Role of Multilateral Corporation

The liberal order is best representing today's global economy.

- 60,000 MNC: expand market, labor...

## The Critics of Liberal Economic Norms

ECLA questioned liberal thinking of developing states

Dependent on others isn't good â‡’ Creation of NIEO (1970s)

- G77 against the GATT: served only developed states

G77 demanded 6 changes:

1. Change terms of trade in international trade (only one that succeeded)
    - Tried to change voting system for developing states
2. Demand more authority for the developing states: regulation on it's MNCs
3. Improve technology transferring
4. More foreign aid and better condition

# 3. Pieces of Global Governance

## Development and Finance

WB, IMF, UN, NGOs

gap between Rich North and Poor South is still wide.

- Income of developing countries are growing
- If the gap is being bridged is based on perspective

## The World Bank

Work on development

- Reconstruct states after WW2
- 50s: provide loan with interest for economic, governmental development
    - With strings attached: policy changes
    - to fund infrastructure projects
- 70s: to improve social services
- 80s: for sustainable development, environment, and poverty
- 90s: loans provided to private companies along with governments.

Focus on giving loans or not to corrupted governments

## International Monetary Fund

Functions:

- To provide loans and help with exchange between currencies
- Initiatives to help poor indebted countries
    - Condition: policy changes
- Annual meetup: to anticipate economic problems

The Mexican Debt Crisis: involved in bailout and structural adjustment

Asian Financial Crisis: Exchange rate, stock market, and real GDP impacted

Revealed weakness of Asian banking system

The IMF added to debt crisis (80s)

- Developing countries couldn't pay their debt
- Can't accomplish set adjustment programs

### Collaboration with NGOs

Mechanisms to tackle poverty in the world, economic development, growth
