# Clausewitz says war is a political instrument

- Political Philosophy of [[War\|War]]: You have to understand politics to understand why war happens
    - Politics: means states policy. What is required for its survival. Including funding, economic
- Clausewitz’s conception of war
{ #8fe086}

    - War is merely the continuation of policy by other means, We see, therefore, that war is not merely an act of policy, but a true political instrument..."
    - But because of its nature it is... "A CLASH OF FORCES FREELY OPERATING AND OBEDIENT TO NO LAWS BUT THEIR OWN,"
    - "War is an act of force intended to compel the enemy to our will."
    - "If you want to overcome your enemy you must match your efforts against his power of resistance... the total means at his disposal and the strength of his will"

1. Policy: war is a means to achieve political objectives
1. Passion/[[Nationalism\|Nationalism]]: is how can you mobilize an entire nation to fight a war.
	- The passion to fight a war must already be inherent in the people for war to happen
	- People do not want to die without a reasonable cause
		- This depends on whether people are civilized or not. 
			- Savages are ruled by passion. 
			- The civilized are ruled by their minds.
	- People can protest and force the government to be rational against war 
	- People with deep dark passions/emotions can be cloud-minded to cause reckless harm to non-combatants [^3]
		- Geneva conventions aims to channel energy of combatants towards actual enemies of war instead of innocent civilians.
1. Probability: To fight a war you have to be very organized
	- State doesn’t have to fight [[Just Wars Theory\|just wars]]: US can invade a country for oil wells
	- **Only state can fight a war**
	- The impulse of armies who were trained to kill enemies must be restrained [^3]
		- War is a political tool to gain a political objective. It shouldn't be something done just for the purpose of war.
		- Can be restrained by employing 'Rules of Engagement' in military
			- Obedience, order, rule, methods
			- To obey laws of war, ethics, mercy, empathy
