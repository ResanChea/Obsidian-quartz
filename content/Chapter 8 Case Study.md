### Definition

Characteristics

- Small case number
- Study of one case to generalize to understand other similar cases
- 
- 

### Purpose

- Create a research question for case study with one of these purposes
    - study event in history: what factors explain the outbreak of the US-Mexican War?
    - deepen understanding: What role does Japan's Yasukuni Shrine play in shaping public memory on the Second World War? (Interpretive)
    - test hypothesis: Why do states comply with international criminal tribunal orders? (Empirical)

### Case Selection Design

- 5 Strategies for Case Selection
    - The Case of Least Likely to be true: test your theory on the hardest case to prove to have confidence in your theory
    - The Case of Most-Similar Comparison: find two cases with the **same in all but one variable** that led to different outcomes. Testing independent variable *(cause)* to the change in dependent variable *(result)*
    - The Case of Least-Similar Comparison: find two cases with **different in all but one variable** that leads to the same out come. Testing if the shared independent variable creates the shared dependent outcome
    - Cross Cases & Over Time Comparison: find **multiple cases** to study across **before and after** periods to prove pattern
    - Deviant Cases: if a case doesn't fit any existing theories, study it to **find new hypothesis** and finding new variables.
