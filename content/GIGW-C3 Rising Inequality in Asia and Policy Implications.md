# Abstract

- Recent trends of rising inequality in developing Asia
- asks why inequality matters
- examines the driving forces of rising inequality
- proposes policy options for tackling high and rising inequality
- Asia's economic growth also has issues of unequal distribution of wealth
    - favor owners of capital over labor worker
    - favored skilled over unskilled workers
    - urban & coastal areas over rural & inland regions
- Institutional weaknesses and social exclusion caused unequal access to opportunities
- You can't block the 3 driving forces of inequality because its the same ones that drive productivity and income growth
- Keywords
    - Spacial Inequality
    - inclusive growth: growth coupled with equality of opportunity to benefit from the system.
    - Income Inequality Decomposition
    - Gini Coefficient: is a common measure of inequality ranging from zero, indicating perfect equality, to 1, indicating perfect inequality.
    - Rent-seeking is the effort to increase one's share of existing wealth without creating new wealth

# 1. Introduction

- Why should we learn about this?
- In the last two decades, Asia's poverty reduction was the fastest ever
    - but it also brings a lot of inequaity
- 'Growth with Equality' in 1960s-70s such as South America where income equality is lower
- Asia's economic growth uneual distribution of wealth
    - favor owners of capital over labor worker
    - favored skilled over unskilled workers
    - urban & coastal areas over rural & inland regions
    - Institutional weaknesses and social exclusion caused unequal access to opportunities

# 2. Recent Trends in Inequality in Developing Asia

- Recent trends of rising inequality in developing Asia
- 1990 to 2010, the average annual growth rate of GDP for developing Asia reached 7% in 2005 (much more than any other region)
    - Poverty rates reduced
    - Living standards improved
- rising inequality of Wealth/Distribution of Income
    - positive correlation with Gini Coefficient & GDP growth
- rising inequality of Opportunity
    - Growth without development: GDP increase but distribution of income/income gap is large
    - poor countries, children is 3-5 times more likely to drop out of primary and secondary school than the richest
    - Tertiary education: poor kids are 10-20 times more likely to not attend college than rich
        - Tertiary education has high gender disparity
    - Infant mortality rates 2-3 times more common in poor than rich households

# 3. Why Inequality Matters

- Why does inequality matter?
    - Economic growth will generate a lower rate of poverty reduction when inequality is increasing than when it remains unchanged or is decreasing
- Does it only concern the poor? How about middle income or rich?
- Does inequality affect any other aspects of society such as environment, people's behaviors?

## How does inequality negatively affect growth?

1. Low income individuals can't use money to invest in **human capital**, therefore staying poor
    - Market failures make them have less chance in borrowing and investing money
    - People barely above poverty line is very sensitive to fall back to poverty due to any economic failure
2. Inequality means small middle-class. Economic growth pushed and benefited by middle-class is more likely to be sustained
    - Economically: rent seeking and corruption associated with highly concentrated gains to growth are avoided
    - Politically: conflict and horizontal inequalities between racial and ethnic groups are easier to manage
3. Political and institutional instability: property rights, crime, and violence
4. Demands for change by the mass poor makes politicians favor policies that benefit the poor rather than economic growth

ðŸ’¡ India's 11th Year Plan: for 'not just faster growth but also inclusive growth, that is, a growth process which yields broad based benefits and ensures equality of opportunity for all.'

China's 11th Five-Year Plan to build a harmonious society

China's 12th not just the rate of growth, and making growth inclusive


- Who are responsible for inequality?
    - Weak Institutions: must create public policies to include individuals marginalized from gender, ethnic origin, parental education, or location of birth
    - Individual's Efforts: efforts in the labor market or in education

# 4. What Drives Inequality in Developing Asia

- What are the driving forces of inequality in Asia?
    - The key drivers of developing Asiaâ€™s rapid growth in the last two decadesâ€”
    technological progress, globalization, and market-oriented reformâ€”have had huge
    distributional consequences
- Does these drivers of inequality apply to everywhere or only Asia?
- Can we attain economic growth/productivity without inequality? is it possible?

# 5. How to Respond to Rising Inequality

- What are the practical ways countries could tackle inequality in their country more directly at its roots rather than to address its symptoms?

# 6. Summary: Towards Inclusive Growth in Asia

Drivers of growth = Drivers of inequality

- These forces require Asian policy makers to redouble their efforts for **inclusive growth**
    - generate more productive jobs: sustained growth to create productive jobs for a wide section of the population
    - equalize opportunities in employment education, and health: social inclusion to equalize access to opportunity
        - help citizens build their human capital
    - address spatial inequality: social safety nets to mitigate vulnerability and risks and prevent extreme poverty
- Inclusive Growth plan is backed by three pillars
