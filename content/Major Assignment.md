# Policy Recommendation

## History Background

In the mid-1990s, the three pillars of the NPT experienced a significant shift. First, the Russian Federation and the US basically froze their disarmament agenda, with the last signed treaty leaving some 1,700 to 2,200 deployed strategic weapons on each side and an unspecified number of tactical, as well as other retired -- but not destroyed -- nuclear weapons on each side. Moreover, the other, smaller, nuclear powers, France, the People's Republic of China, and the United Kingdom, stood clear of the complete nuclear disarmament threshold. The total number of functioning nuclear weapons remained and still is in the range of 25,000. In 1998, two newly declared nuclear powers arose -- though unofficial from the standpoint of the NPT. And later, for the first time, one country, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), exited the NPT and conducted a nuclear test.

contributing to the feeling that the era of nuclear disarmament ended

- Treaties were not signed
- IAEA's 'additional protocol' were also not signed

The cessation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty; the threat by the Russian Federation to withdraw from the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in response both to the new proposed deployments of missile defence systems in Europe by the US, and to the increased intermediate range missile capabilities in many Asian countries

â‡’ NPT is in critical condition

- nuclear disarmament lost its character of being a shared ideal or value of the international community and instead became one of the many instruments of partisan foreign policy
- Making NPT a standard would make proliferators lose credibility and influence, lack of disarmament may encourage proliferation in the future
- the non-proliferation campaign is used as an excuse to impose sanctions or wage war against a country that is labelled evil to induce regime change
    - Capable of nuclear countries are punished less than less capable of nuclear 'evil' states

# The Present or recent past

- 2009: Former high level officials from US and European countries published articles arguing to restart nuclear disarmament
- 2009: Barrack Obama interest in restarting dialogue with Russia to renew Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
    
    > "I state clearly and with conviction America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons."
    > 

## To reduce importance of nuclear weapons, not eliminate it

- For nuclear states to minimize their stock of nuclear weapons
- For nuclear weapons to not be the first action against a missile strike

# Policy Recommendation

As laid out above, the United Nations' response and have been a relative success but not without problems. There are several things that could be changed or improved upon in the UN's management of nuclear weapons usage and production.

In the past decade, we've seen significantly more proliferation of nuclear weapons technology and production. In 2019, North Korea tested its nuclear warhead, Iran had restarted its nuclear program in 2018, while India and Pakistan continues to develop their nuclear weapon systems. [(AIR)](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/SSQ/documents/Volume-14_Issue-3/Lee.pdf) Therefore, the Nuclear Non Proliferation treaty should restrict on member states' obligations in eliminating nuclear weapons and acquire a tougher monitoring system and binding enforcement system for violators of the treaty.

The ability to transfer the process of producing fuel from uranium into the production of nuclear weapons is a far too easy process. Therefore, the United Nations must strictly disallow non-weapons states to even get access to nuclear fuel production. For states which already have such process must be monitored closely and kept on the production of peaceful nuclear energy only. [(NYT)](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/09/opinion/09sun1.html)

Although the NPT emphasize the importance of not spreading nuclear weapons to non-nuclear states, it does not address the already existing arsenal in all the 9 nuclear states have in stock. Over three thousand nuclear weapons exists and only a handful is required to level every part of the world. [(ARM)](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Nuclearweaponswhohaswhat). The NPT should have more conditions on the nuclear states in actively reducing their stock of nuclear warheads rather than wait for a nuclear war to start.
