The meeting:

- We tested out the breakout feature of zoom and set the time for each breakout session
- I informed everyone of the two students who didn't have phones/PC and their buddy group will handle each of them
- added 'ask them to put real names in zoom' in our rules to inform students in tomorrow meeting
- others facilitators are pretty serious about having students change their topic to make sure its right by this Sunday
- guest speakers will use their own computer and slides share screen due to ease of use and fear of problems with them controlling my computer through zoom
