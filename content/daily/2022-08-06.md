## Log
- After looking over your documents, I still have a few questions and concerns.
- Regarding the work permit, will there be any agency or Accenture itself helping me create one? Will Accenture be compensate for the costs of aquiring one?
- What is the dressing code like?
- Working environment
- Could Accenture help me with aquiring accomodation or a place to stay since I've never been to Thailand?


- There's a sign on bonus
	- Since I start on the [[2022-10-31\|2022-10-31]], it's after 16th day
		- Sign on bonus will be paid to you at the next available payroll payout cycle after your first month of employment
		- U have to stay employed for at least 12 months to get it tho
