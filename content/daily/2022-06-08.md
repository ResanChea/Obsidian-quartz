## Log
- Cambodia is balancing instead of bandwagoning
	- Balancing is siding with the rising power instead the existing super power
	- Why would Cambodia balance (China) instead of bandwagon (US)
		- Need to preserve one-party system that is against Western value
			- Isolation by the west due to human rights and democracy
				- Withdraw of EBA
				- 

- If Cambodia were to shift closer to China, how can Cambodia make the best of the situation?
	>[!quote] "But to better leverage the opportunities China provides, Cambodia should work harder to steer those investments into skills development in electronics manufacturing, the automotive sector and food processing. Instead, [85 per cent of the US$10 billion](https://www.policyforum.net/the-impact-of-changing-relations-between-china-and-vietnam/) China spent in Cambodia up to 2018 is concentrated in natural resource extraction, real estate and energy."
	- Invest in skill based industries instead of low value added extractions [^1]
