- Negotiation did stop the fighting and solved the temporary issue
	- Negotiation wasn't a complete failure
	- ICJ or binding negotiation is needed for dealing with root cause 
	- Challenges are the things which stopped the negotiation from completing
		- Politicizing the conflict: find evidence of how each party used the issue to gain support.
	- Opportunities: What are the factors that made the negotiation move forward?
		- The imbalance of small power wanting to involve the ICJ more than the bigger power
		- The politicalization of the conflict is the challenge to the negotiation, not the opportunity to progressing the negotiation.

- [ ] IS410 Read Chapter 10, maybe chapter 11 [[daily/2022-06-08\|2022-06-08]]
