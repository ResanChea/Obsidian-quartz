## Log
- As the west is increasingly distancing Cambodia due to democratic and human rights concerns. Under the Belt and Roads Inniative, Cambodia placed its reliance onto China's ever-increasing ambitions. Cambodia seems to shift closer to sheltering than the non-alignment status it voices. Therefore, Cambodia should align to its official non-aligned status and diversify its interests rather than falling into bandwagonning or the debt-trap of China, which will make the country's economy vulnerable to one actor.
