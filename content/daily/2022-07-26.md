## Log
- During this Coronavirus pandemic, my family has been doing okay. We continue to grow rice as normal. Everyday, we find fish and pick vegetables by ourselves to cook our meals. Recently, the RFCD organization has been teaching kids like me how to draw. When finished, we received gifts like school supplies, hygiene products, and snacks. Whenever COVID-19 settles down, I'd like to return to school. Furthermore, I was so happy when taking the vaccine. Still, though, we practice safety precautions, just in case. Finally, I want to thank you very much for your contribution to my village.
