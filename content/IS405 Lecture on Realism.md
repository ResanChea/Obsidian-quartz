        - If some event is not analyzed deeply you can still use it

        - It's unlikely to pick the same event and different groups have different perspectives

- [[Realism\|Realism]] came from the need to explain the real world in opposition of 'what the world could be' in idealism
- Realism focuses on war and peace
    - The Dooms Day Clock helps support Realism
- Only large states or super powers can decide what will happen to the world
    - not even small states
    - NGOs or terrorist groups etc doesn't have power
- Hegemony isn't a good thing in Realism
    - Hegemon is a threat to every other state
        - â†’ creating coalitions and war against the rising hegemon
    - Hegemon is preponderance: a great power with large gaps between other great powers
- Anarchy: no overarching authority above a state (world government)
{ #8db9d3}

    - Can't rely on the UN without consensus from every member state
    - Must rely on yourself
- Russia, Syria, and Iraq defeated ISIS (#NeedResearch)

# [[Security Dilemma\|Security Dilemma]]

- Security Dilemma: its the difficult choice between choosing to continue building their power and stopping.

- States A cannot stay in one place or risk being invaded by state B who builds up their power.
    - State B will take an opportunity to take out their enemy (State A)
- No matter what you choose to do you will be end with the bad result of War
    - That's why its a dilemma
- International System being anarchic is what makes states act that way.

# How to get peace

Using balance of power

- How to attain peace with realism

- START: Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty to limit the arms power and nuclear weapons power between the Soviet and United States
    - Cold War ended without any hot wars
- Balance of Power: for smaller countries to band together and challenge a larger power but not exceed it
- Peace can occur in the midst of arms race, possession of nuclear power

- How to measure, reassure the balance of power between states
    - There is an art that Diplomats use to communicate effectively and transparently between countries
    - [Calculating Credibility] (Book) on methods to calculate relative power
        - Past action theory vs current calculus

- [[Classical Realism\|Classical Realism]] is the first attempt to make realism a scientific theory
    - Realism was a philosophy: an art of governance
- Neo-Realism | [[Structural Realism\|Structural Realism]]: Kenneth Waltz created it
    - Focus on structure
    - 1919-1939: League of Nations is Idealist thinking of woodrow wilson
    - Edward Hallett Carr's The Twenty Years Crisis and Morgenthau's Politics Among Nations is the founding texts of Classical Realism
    - Kenneth Waltz's book [[Man, the State, and War\|Man, the State, and War]]. Human nature is not the cause of war.
        - The inherent problems with international system:
- a system has three components
    1. Interacting Units are states
    2. Ordering Principle: rule of interaction between units. Between two rules
        - Hierarchical: not possible
        - Anarchic
    3. Distribution of Power: who is big and who is small. The only characteristic of a system that varies and changeable
        - Uni-polarity
        - Bi-polarity
        - Multi-polarity
    
    Waltz says the system's polarity is the only variable that can change
    
    - and when it does change it leads to world wars
        - says uni-polarity always create a coalition against them
        - multi-polarity will create many opportunities for war
        - bi-polarity is the most stable and will last forever
            - even if one super power got every power in the int system to go against the other super power, it doesn't mean that much
            
    - when alliances happen even for the smallest country the international system becomes unstable and creates multiple potential enemies for the entire system
        - Both world war 1 and 2 started from small countries expanding their power
    - What happens when bi-polarity changes to uni-polarity without a war? cold war ended peacefully?

# [[Defensive Realism\|Defensive Realism]]

- Defensive realism is too technical?
    - Developed while analyzing events of WW1
    - Is war perpetual?
    - foreign policy should be to defend oneself to stay in peace
    - If expansionism won't pay anymore the offensive-defensive balance is at equalibrium
        - Defensive realism says Weapons technology is defense dominant. Arms are meant to be used for defense
        - except railroads
        - Defensive realism failed to predict what happens so many times, WW1, WW2
        - Jack Snyder defends its faults
    - If weapons technology is Offensive dominant means the offensive has an advantage or defender must use offensive tactics for protection

# [[Offensive Realism\|Offensive Realism]]

- Offensive and Defensive realism isn't opposite in the role of weapons technology
    - Foreing Policy of offensive realism is for states to secure survival states must attack others to gain the most power
- John Mearsheimer's assumptions
- Combined together, the nature of the international system makes system act in an offensive way to gain hegemony for survival
- Why do states gain power?
    - Global hegemony by one state isn't possible
    - States are encouraged to become regional hegemon in local area
    - And the area's regional hegemon becomes the "offshore balancer", to fill a power vacuum, prevent another state from being a regional hegemon in this region
- Tragedy of Great Power Politics: Even knowing One power controlling the world isn't possible (hegemony), regional hegemons still try to get global hegemon
- Continental power doesn't have naval capability of Island Great Power who doesn't have the land capabilities of continental power (Russia & UK)
- Neo-Classical Realism is a return back to classical texts of realism from Kenneth's realism
