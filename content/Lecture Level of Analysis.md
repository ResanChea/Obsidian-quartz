# Level of Analysis

- What is level of analysis?
- How many general levels are there?

## Individual Level

- In the FPD, it depends on the individuals that make those decisions
- FP makers aren't always fully rational. Influenced by Emotional, cognitive, psychological and sometimes biological factors
    - Cognitive Factors
        - **Seeking cognitive consistency**: ignoring inconsistent information that contradict their existing view therefore making mistake in their decision making
        - **Wishful Thinking**: to justify own's decision, human often convince ourselves the choice will succeed
        - **Using Heuristic Devices**: Using stereotypes to generalize and make decisions easier without guilt or injustice
    - Emotional Factor: emotional decisions can lead to mistakes and dangerous decisions
    - Psychological Factor: frustration and anger can turn into aggression without logic in decision making
    - Biological Factors: animalistic nature of gender can determine the likelihood of use of war
    - Perception Factor: people see the world in different perspectives than others. These differing perspectives or perceptions can overlook other's perspectives and thinking us is better than them.

## State-Level Analysis
