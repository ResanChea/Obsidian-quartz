# Chapter 7: The search for peace and security

# 1. Case Study: Somalia

1991 war created famine and starvation. UNSG Boutros Boutros-Ghali says they have no alternative but to be more forceful.

- They required consent for humanitarian assistance before
- Inadequate attempts of peacekeeping

US-led forces (UNITAF) (26,000 troops)

- to control ports and airfields
- to protect humanitarian relief workers
- wanted to impose cease-fire and disarm factions but US declined to broaden scope

US did this for publicity of feeding Somalians but fatally failed. How?

## Peacemaking Failure

The initial US-led humanitarian were successful

- supplied food
- imposed de facto cease-fire in area of deployment

But it failed in peacemaking

## Replacement with UNOSOM II

In 1993 US-led UNITAF was replaced by UNOSOM II

- Less troops (20,000)
- lacked heavy equipment and airpower

It was given ability to use force to disarm factions

23 UNOSOM II soldiers killed ⇒ targeted General Aidid

The UN role switched from peacekeeper to a conflicting party (Defensive → Offensive)

## US dying relationship with the UN

1993: US soldier killed by Aidid and dragged through the streets

- US citizen outcry over UN's role in Somalia

1994: US rethought it's commitment to UN then halted troops from Haiti democratic government restoration

- April: US blocked UNSC response to genocide in Rwanda
- US didn't call Rwanda situation genocide

June 1994: US's Presidential Decision Directive 25: restricted situations in which US is to support or participate in UN peacekeeping operations

## Ending of UNOSOM II

US afraid to risk soldier's lives

→ 1995 UN operations stopped too

- US was 5,000/20,000 of the operation troops

Result:

- Ended the famine
- Didn't help reestablish national government
- Didn't help end civil war

## Attempts of transitional government and more famine

- Since 2000 attempts of transitional governments failed
- Ethiopia sent US-backed troops to stop terrorism concerns until 2009
- 2007: UNSC authorized Ugandan to do peacekeeping but they only sent small number of troops and were attacked

Calls for UN action

- No response or offer of troops

Result:

- Another large-scale famine (2008)
- Somalia pirates threatens international peace and security in Gulf of Aden

---

Somalia is an example of UN failed peacekeeping.

Challenges posed by

- Changing nature of armed conflicts after Cold War
- Humanitarian crisis and state failure when human security > state security
- International community using more military force to deal with conflicts

# 2. War as origin of security governance

War is the reason IGOs are created.

20th century was the most destructive but it was the building peace in preventing wars (creation of IGOs & int' laws)

## 2.1. The nature of war has changed

The past 60 years

- there are less interstate war
- there are dramatically more intrastate conflicts
    
    Mostly struggles for self determination
    

The total number of active conflicts since 1990s are down

But armed conflicts are still a major problem.

## 2.2. Fewer new conflicts or better at solving old ones

Hewitt concludes long-standing conflicts are resolved more

- New conflicts emerged at the same rate the last 60 years

But Today's active conflicts: mostly from unresolved Long-standing conflicts between adversaries and sometimes erupt again

## 2.3. Human Security > State Security

Post Cold-War intrastate conflicts brings

- humanitarian disasters
- ethnic cleansing or genocide
- collapse of governmental authority
- famine and disease

1950 - 2000:

Shift from Westphalian's state security over human rights

Into human rights norms, state responsible to protect humans from violence of state

---

Changing nature of war and complex humanitarian disasters are two challenges to peace in 21st century

Two more Challenges to Peace

- Weapons of Mass Destruction
- Terrorism

## International Institutions in Security Governance

UN provide global structure for dealing with security issues

5 major geographic regions each have their own IGOs dealing with security issues

Each have different conception of 'nature of war' ⇒ different solutions to problem of war

## 2.4. IGO and Security

Origin of IGO to promote security

- First emerged early 20th century during WW1 and WW2
- Regional Security Organizations appeared after Cold War

LoN and UN believes a permanent international organization

- with peace-loving states as members
- Could prevent future wars

Lon and UN had charters had principles to prevent wars

- peaceful dispute settlement mechanism: mediation and good offices
- provision of more enforcement actions

Regional security arrangements established during Cold War were

- Traditional Alliances: mutual aid during attack
- Collective Defense Organization: NATO more commitment

ASEAN: had different approach

- Confidence building
- Conflict prevention

UNSC has authority to authorize use of force and make member states undertake sanctions

But Article 53: no enforcement action shall be taken under regional arrangements or by regional agencies without the authorization of the Security Council

### 2.4.1. UN and Regional Organizations Cooperating

There was not a clear division of labor of peacekeeping between UN and RGO

1992: An Agenda for Peace: called for more regional cooperation with UN to share the burden.

Late 1990s: more regional IGO peace operations than UN operations

## 2.5. NGOs and Security

Security NGOs

- Think Tanks: research to understand and make better maintain a stable peace
- International Crisis Group: major source of analysis and advice
    - Lead by former government officials
    
    Noteworthy for it's
    
    - Crisis alerts: in advising peace negotiations
    - offering new strategic thinking on intractable conflicts
- NGOs focusing on arms control and disarmament issues
    - Greenpeace
- Humanitarian relief operations

## 2.6. Norms Related to the Use of Force

LoN didn't prohibit use of force to settle disputes.

Pact of Paris: to condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies

UN Charter: all members to settle disputes by peaceful means

- UNSC allowed use of force for self-defense
    - Response must be proportional to the attack
- Accepted use of force for self-determination

### Promoting Human Security and Humanitarianism

Geneva Conventions: as core of international humanitarian law

protect civilians, prisoners of war, wounded soldiers, and legal base of war crimes

Human rights and humanitarian laws led NGOs to pressure new demands on UN, IGOs and Int. actors.

The Genocide Convention: UN able to prevent or suppress crimes against humanity

To become international norm/customary it must be common practice

- Norm Cascades: set in motion of new norm replacing old

Responsibility to Protect (R2P) norm

Why can authorize humanitarian intervention?

UNSC has authority

- Asia and Africa wanted protection from imperialism and non-interference.

## 2.7. Linking International Theories and Security Governance

**Realism**

- "hard" variety: states are likely to use force
    - Create a balance of power
    - Only superpowers are able to intervene, but usually don't have the incentive to
- "soft" variety: more types of actors negotiate for peace
    - Broader range of actors
    - Diplomacy and Mediation to change cost-benefit analysis to deter war

**Liberals** see NGOs, IGOs, individuals, states, groups may play third party role in settling disputes peacefully

- Use democratic peace theory for post conflict peacebuilding
- Liberal cooperation: explains how content of agreements shape durability of peace after war

**Constructivism:** explained how use of force for norms has changed and which groups should be protected.

# 3. Mechanisms for the peaceful settlement of disputes

1899 and 1908 Hague Conferences made Conventions for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes

The Hague Conventions put int. community role in preventing wars with mechanisms

- Good Office
- Inquiry
- Mediation
- Conciliation
- Adjudication
- Arbitration

## 3.1. Preventive Diplomacy

> “Preventive diplomacy is action to prevent disputes from arising between parties, to prevent existing disputes from escalating into conflicts and to limit the spread of the latter when they occur"
- Boutros Bourtros-Ghali
> 

Preventive diplomacy is to change thinking of parties about purpose of political violence and deter escalation of conflict.

- Timeliness: it's more successful in low violence
    - 1990s: UN Secretariat intelligence gathering for early warning systems
    - International Crisis Group: important provider of early crisis warning and help IOs preventing it.

## 3.2. Mediation

A negotiation where a third party help conflicting parties find solution they could not find by themselves.

- It works when parties see the cost of continuing violence is more than the benefits

Mediator comes from

- Powerful states: US
- Middle State: Norway, Canada
- IGOs & NGOs

Mediators roles

- If without official power: could help bring parties together to meet
- With power: could halt fighting and provide incentive and assurance for formal settlement

Relationship between sponsoring institution such as UN or mediator's own relationship also matters.

## 3.3. Adjudication and Arbitration

### Arbitration

Parties consent to refer dispute to impartial third-party tribunal court for a binding decision.

Finding the settlement in international law rather than a diplomatic process.

Arbitration panels can be composed of 

- a single neutral individual such as the UN secretary- general
- Optional: two each chosen by a party

Agreement between the parties define the method of selecting arbitrator, the machinery and procedures, and the expense to be paid.

### Adjudication

Are courts that already exist and paid by the international community

Challenges:

- Difference between legal disputes and political dispute is unclear
- Jurisdiction: Parties don't show up to announce their consent at all

---

Adjudication and Arbitration in solving territorial disputes both if they intend to use force or not.

Bilateral treaties between the two parties are what decide either Arbitration or Adjudication for dispute settlement.

States may refuse to implement the settlement outcome

→ enforcement issue needing help from UNSC

# Q&A

1. The UNITAF forces (20,000) was mostly US soldiers, in 1993 a US soldier in Somalia was murdered and was dragged through the streets humiliating the US. The protests and outcry pressured the governments to participate less in the UN.

2. Think tanks are more of institutions such as schools who do research about social policy, economy, politics etc, while the NGOs in the slides i meant more of NGOs that focused on arms control. Those NGOs contributed to security matters.

3. They all contribute to global security, but they are different. Preventive diplomacy is for when the conflict already happened and is a low violence conflict, while ASEAN's way is confidence building among it's members to not let conflicts happen in the first place. If a conflict happen, they will still take the same process of conflict settlement mechanisms. And R2P is about State to citizens relations, not about state-to-state conflicts. and R2P is good in general as states must actively protect human security from violence.
