## Negotiation

- Negotiation: the process of formal discussions between two parties to reach a mutually beneficial agreement that resolves a conflict
    - Types of Negotiation:
        - Distributive Negotiation: one party give very little while demanding very much
            - zero-sum negotiation
            - a party unwilling to give any compromise
            - all for self-interest
        - Integrative Negotiation: finding mutually beneficial solution for a win-win
- BATNA: Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement
    - Don't accept a deal worse than what you can get with a backup option
    - Have strong BATNA gives more leverage on bargaining for more
- Anchoring: the initial offer put out early in negotiation by a party from where negotiation shifts the offer
    - Don't accept initial offer
    - Over aggressive anchor can derail the deal
- Reservation Price: is the bottom line/least favorable point at which a party will accept an agreement
    - negotiation can get better than the reservation price
- ZOPA: The Zone of Possible Agreement (Actual Bargaining Range)
    - Only Reservation Price of the buyer is â‰¥ Reservation Price of the seller is the deal acceptable by the seller
- Framing: negotiation method of downplaying one aspect (negative) and focus on another (positive) of the deal or selective attention
