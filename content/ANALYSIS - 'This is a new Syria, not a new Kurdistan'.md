# ANALYSIS - 'This is a new Syria, not a new Kurdistan'

### Evergreen Relations

1. [[Syrian Civil War\|Syrian Civil War]] 
2. [[Non-Territorial Autonomy\|Non-Territorial Autonomy]] 

*characteristics similar to a federation*

> “This is after the failure of the dictatorship regimes, that ignore the rights of other nations apart from themselves.”
> 
- The country has been in the early process of federalizing the country from the past of government abusing its power over citizens.
- Has the last ‘dictatorship’ government collapsed? #needRESEARCH

> The Syrian Kurds therefore have moved from a Kurdish self-administration, towards a federal democratic Syria.
> 
- Kurds have plans to federalize and they have power. But does the actual government of Syria have any plans to federalize? Is the issue of civil war still affecting this country in federalization? #needRESEARCH
    - does Kurds plan to be semi-autonomous or have self-rule?

It’s speculated Kurds did this to gain recognizing & representation in new Syria

Is Rojava (Kurd area) already an example for federalism in Syria?
