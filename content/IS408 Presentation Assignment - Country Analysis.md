## Policy Memo

- Topic: "trying to improve the economy by focusing on the service sector"
	- in order to do so, 
		- we need to improve our education system (investment for the future). 
		- We will also look at the participation rate of the women and try to improve the rate of women being part of the economy as well.
- Solution is by improving Mexico's education system. 
	- Why should education be improved?
	- Problems
		- Underfunded
			- Where does government funds go instead? 
			- Is it worth reallocating?
		- Why past policies of compulsory upper-secondary education didn't work?
- Solution is by increasing economic participation rate of women

	- What can be done to increase?
