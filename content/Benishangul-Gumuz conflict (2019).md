# How it started

- During the emperorship of Haile Selassie and the following [[Derg\|Derg]] epoch
    - Ethiopia was mostly ruled by Mengistu Haile Mariam
    - ethnic discrimination occurred against Afars, Tigrayans, Eritreans, Somalis and Oromos
- In the following period, ethnic federalism was implemented by [[Tigray People's Liberation Front\|Tigray People's Liberation Front]]  leader Meles Zenawi
    - discrimination against Amharas, Oromos and other ethnic groups continued during TPLF rule.

The Conversation [^2]

- Metekkel is home to ethnic groups (majority Gumuz) are opposed to Amhara state's claim to ownership of the zone
    - for mineral deposits
    - for farmable lands
- armed malitias from Gumuz attacked Oromo, Amhara, Shinasha, Awi resents of Metekkel (Sep 2020 â†’ Mar 2021)
- Gumuz and Shinasha control the 6 districts, unrepresentative of other ethnic groups
- the area ethnic interests deviated from one another because
    - marginalisation
    - ethnic exclusion
    - poor governance
    - the absence of workable democratic mechanisms
- at its core, the conflict might be about ethnic, but its bascially its about political conflicts

Al Jazeera [^1]

- Cause: Because the crackdown on the OLA by the government, who betrayed them, the OLA retaliated demanding autonomy and interdependence from a federal state ([[Ethiopia\|Ethiopia]] )
- Response: The government turns a blind eye to and normalize the killings without finding justice. They put on ineffective state of emergencies and essentially made Ethiopia a failed state
- Solutions:
    - Ethiopian people should be the one deciding Ethiopia's future, not a prime minister or political party and all ethnic groups should be represented equally not just one ethnic group.
    - To fix this, the system of [[Tigray People's Liberation Front\|Tigray People's Liberation Front]] , where Amharas are second class citizens if they are not in their ethnic region, should be thrown out. [^1]
    - National dialogue between OLA and government and between ethnic groups must happen to stop ethnic discrimination and genocide.
