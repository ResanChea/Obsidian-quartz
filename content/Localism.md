# Localism

- Localism is the problem where the diplomat of a country overseas will adopt the host stateâ€™ s point of view
	- Losing touch with sentiments at home
	- at worst becoming the mouthpiece for the host government and representing interests of the host state

- Why localism happens?
	- Immersion with local culture and isolation from home
	- Gratitude & gifts from influential figures of host country

- Solution to localism: cycle ambassadors from being too attached to hosting country (3-4 years at a time)
	- Diplomats/ambassadors can return to work in the same country, but not with long consecutive time periods
