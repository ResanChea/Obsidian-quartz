# EDPSE-C4: Contemporary Economic Development

# Underdevelopment as coordination failure

- Theories specifying what must work for development to occur and maintain
    - **Complementaries**: when it is present, an action taken by one agent will incentivize other agents to take similar actions
        - investments must be made by many agents for any individual agent to profit
        - **Coordination Failure**: is a state of affair where agents fail to act together → all agents worse off (equilibrium) instead of the complementaries equilibrium
            - Everyone has different expectation
            - Everyone’s waiting for someone to take the first move
        - Ex: The big push that reinforce the O-ring model
            - People use MS Office because everyone use it, → circular causation of positive feedback loop
        - Ex: **Middle Income Trap**: sunk cost fallacy
            - They develop, but lack innovative capacity to reach high-income
        - Ex: Small agricultural industry aren’t trust worthy in their quality, they need middlemen to sell to big buyers, to be qualified for middleman qualifications farmers need to specialize in a certain crop, but farmers have no incentive to do that since there is no buyers yet.
            - Underdevelopment Trap: region remaining subsistent agriculture forever
        - “Chicken or Egg” “Skill or Investment” Comes first:
            - **Solution**: coordination of skill and investment coming at the same time. Government can take first step to make both happen at once
- **Governments** can be the initiator in complementaries, but it can also halt development
    - Authoritarian Government thinks it might lose power if economy develops too far
    - Solution: governments should make the economy more self-sustaining, where there is no incentive to go back to the bad equilibrium?
        - What can the government do to solve coordination failures?
- Complementaries doesn’t exist in most places: especially where demand > supply in a competitive market
    - Where to meet problem: farmers doesn’t know what to specialize in

# Multiple Equilibria Diagram

- The benefits for an agent for taking an action positively correlates to how many other agents are expected to take the same action and the extent of those actions
- The equilibrium is when the agent sees what it expects to see
    - Agents chase their expected changes in the market → settling on the equilibrium either from up or down
- Both traditional and modern sector workers are important to holistic economic growth.
- There are 3 possible equilibrium
    - Why is D1 and D3 are more stable
        - In D2, if investment were a little bit over expectations it move to D3, if a little below it would move to D1
- Change starts slow as few agents invest in unexpected, then snowball effect to rapid change, then slow down again (S)
- Pareto-ranked Equilibrium: higher utility of it is beneficial to everyone (higher equilibrium is always better)
    - Ex: Investment market: more investors benefits all investors, but its usually hard to get to the equilibrium
        - Country’s middle income trap: industry not growing, no investment
    - Requires government policy to move from a bad equilibria to a better one.
        - [[The Invisible Hand\|The Invisible Hand]] of markets might change equilibrium, but can’t control direction: to bad/good

# The Big Push

- by Paul Rosenstein-Rodan
- Coordination failures make states fail to industrialize
    - The first firms to spend on training which benefits later firms ⇒ no one wants to be the first firm ⇒ no industrialization
    - The first firms can’t sell to its citizens or workers without the existence of other firms of different products
- To reach industrialization an economy needs a market failure to
    - cause economywide and probably public-policy-led effort to hugely reform and push for an economic development
- Assumptions of the Big Push
    1. Factors: Labor (L): the only factor of production. It is a fixed total supply.
    2. 2 sectors with same production function (same input, same tech)
        - Workers in traditional sector’s Wage = 1
        - Workers in modern sector’s Wage > 1
    3. Technology: (N) types of products, where N is a large number
        - Traditional Sector: 1 worker produces 1 unit of output (if it means 3 pairs of shoes a day)
            - What is constant return to scale production?
        - Modern Sector:
            - What is increasing return to scale production?
                - no product can be produced unless a minimum of (F) workers are employed
                - labor requirements for producing any product in the modern sector take the form of $L=F+cQ$
                    - where (c) < 1 is the marginal labor required for an extra unit of output
                - modern workers are more productive, but only if a significant cost is paid up front
                    - Increasing return to scale: makes every unit cheaper the more they are mass produced (economy of scale, production of scale)
    4. Domestic Demands: Each good receives a constant and equal share of consumption out of national income (Y)
        - There is no savings
        - National Income (Y) = Consumption
    5. International Supply and Demand: 
        - Domestic consumerism: service, quality, economy of scale, price... must be ensured before it can sell on the international markets
        - Export-led economies have benefited from active industrial policy aimed at overcoming coordination failures
    6. Market Structure: Don’t understand!!!
- The role of the government to correct market failure is acknowledge
    - They have to attract the first factories to set up (but very difficult because:)
        - Intertemporal effects: no immediate result, takes lot of time to get result
        - because no existing infrastructure
        - have to train workers
            - Which benefits later investors who have already trained workers
        - Urbanization only happens when factories are already set up. But firms won’t set up factories in rural areas in the first place
    - The government or public sector must be the one to bare the cost of the first step for firms to move in
        - Government only have to pay for the initial stage of development, further development will be paid by incoming firms
- Why problem can’t be solved by Super-Entrepreneur investing instead of government?
    - Super-Entrepreneur can’t bring in all the money into economy
    - Too many things to be responsible for
        - Electricity generation
        - Pipe, electricity laying
        - Road and bridge building and maintaining
    - Communication failure
        - Lack of access to information on time
    - Limit to knowledge
        - Locals don’t know how to manage building bridges, roads, telecommunication...
        - They only know how to do simple things like garment
    - Not enough empirical data to show its possible

# O Ring Model

- the O-ring model of economic development, this refers to the theory that even the smallest components of a complex production process must be performed properly if the end product of the process is to have any useful value.
- O Ring Model: firms must properly coordinate to all benefit
    - Production is modeled with strong complementarities among inputs
    - Positive assortative matching in production
- Implications of strong complementarities for economic development and the distribution of income across countries
- Positive associative matching
    - Group high skill with high skill
    - Group low skill with low skill
- To develop economy you have to develop the successful sector
    - Challenges
        - Uncertainty about which products can produce efficiently
            - Ex: India's success in information technology was unexpected;
            - Ex: reasons for Bangladesh's efficiency in hats vs Pakistan's in bedsheets is not clear
        - Need for local adaptation (evidence: seen in cases such as shipbuilding in South Korea): can’t transfer directly what works in one country to another without modifications
        - Imitation can be rapid (e.g. the spread of cut flower exporting in Colombia): late comers grow much easier from your earlier success
# Self Discovery
- States don't know their comparative advantage and what they should specialize in naturally
	- They must discover that themselves
	- **Problem**: During the process of discovery, they could face market failure
## Questions and Answers
- What are the models in the chapter:
	- Multiple Equilibria
		- The Big Push
	- Michael Kremer's O-Ring model
	- Economic Development as Self-Discovery
	- The Hausmann-Rodrik-Velasco Growth Diagnostics Framework
1. One of the characteristics of some developing economies is the relatively low level of trust of people outside one's extended family. 
	- How might the models explored in this chapter shed light on this problem?
2. What kinds of market failures are present in the economic self-discovery framework?
	- how may they be overcome?
