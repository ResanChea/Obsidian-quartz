- Cause: Because the crackdown on the OLA by the government, who betrayed them, the OLA retaliated demanding autonomy and interdependence from a federal state ([[Ethiopia\|Ethiopia]] )
- Response: The government turns a blind eye to and normalize the killings without finding justice. They put on ineffective state of emergencies and essentially made Ethiopia a failed state
- Solutions:
    - Ethiopian people should be the one deciding Ethiopia's future, not a prime minister or political party and all ethnic groups should be represented equally not just one ethnic group.
    - To fix this, the system of [[Tigray People's Liberation Front\|Tigray People's Liberation Front]] , where Amharas are second class citizens if they are not in their ethnic region, should be thrown out. [1]
    - National dialogue between OLA and government and between ethnic groups must happen to stop ethnic discrimination and genocide.

### Highlights and Notes

- Humanitarian crisis in Western Ethiopia: targeted attacks against Amaha ethnics by Oromo Libertion Army (OLA?)
    - 250 killed, many displaced
    - Genocide going on
    - government had to step in to help Amhara army
- Why are they killing Amharas indiscriminately?
    - Source: Because of launch of military crackdown on the OLA caused retaliation
    - Argument: there has been no evidence that they are attacked simply because they were Amharas
        - Different groups like the government and Amharas have different vision on what Ethiopia should be
            - Federal multinational state
            - centralized system of government
    - The TPLF and OLF are creating ethnic conflicts between Amharas and Oromos to destabilize the country to capture power
- Oromos believe they are their own nation and want autonomy and independence (as said by a commander of OLA-West)
    - Argues that Ethiopia is getting worse
        - Governmental actions like state of emergencies doesn't do anything
        - "Ethiopia is a failed state"
- It's clear the government isn't finding justice for people responsible for the killings
    - leaders not issuing statements or mention killings
    - Normalizing events of mass killings
- Is the conflicts/instability because of the bad transition of power?
    - Yes, the last election or leader betrayed their winning party (Oromo) and tried to make his own vision of Ethiopia
- How to solve this?
    - the TPLF's system should go along with the party
    - Amharas shouldn't be second class citizens if they're not living in their ethnic region
    - The future of Ethiopia should be dicided by the people, not by a political party or Prime minister
        - All Ethnic groups should be represented equally. If only amharas are represented in future Ethiopia it will create more conflicts than now
    - Need a national dialogue
- The [[Tigray People's Liberation Front\|Tigray People's Liberation Front]] is not in power any more
