# South China Sea Dispute: Thailand Position

### **Thailand**

Thailand as one of the member of [ASEAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Southeast_Asian_Nations) played a coordinating role in facilitating China and ASEAN members involved in the dispute in hope of reaching peaceful resolution. Despite its domestic political turmoil, the Thai government relied on its Ministry of Foreign Affairs' expertise on international dispute. It took the initiative to hold several meetings with parties concerned. Thailand's first attempt was hosting the ASEAN–China Senior Officials' Meeting Retreat in Pattaya, Thailand 2012. Via this meeting, [Wang Yi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi_(politician)), the Chinese Foreign Minister called for a joint development of resources in South China Sea. Bangkok was viewed as an South China Sea neutral player because it is not a claimant and did not have disputes in the South China Sea with China. After several meetings, the 6th ASEAN–China SOM on DOC was the first official consultation on the Code of Conduct (COC) was formed with all parties agreement to push forward the drafting of COC. Thai-China relationship was generally seen as positive. Thailand's neutral position enabled it to act as a mediator and influence discussions among parties involved.

## The [Code of Conduct](//https_www.scmp.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scmp.com%2Fnews%2Fchina%2Fdiplomacy-defence%2Farticle%2F2105190%2Fwhat-south-china-sea-code-conduct-and-why-does-it) (2017)

The concept of a code of conduct was first raised in the 1990s; but it was not until 2002 at a gathering of foreign ministers from Asean countries and China in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, that a code of conduct was mandated by the non-binding China-Asean Declaration on Conduct of the Parties in the South China Sea.
