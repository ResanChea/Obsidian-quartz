# Typology of IR Feminist theories

Many of these feminist theories build on, but go beyond some of the IR perspective such as liberalism, constructivism, critical theory, poststructuralism and post colonialism. 

### Liberal feminism - [[Liberalism\|Liberalism]]

Liberal [[Feminism\|Feminism]]  calls attention to the subordinate position of women in global politics but remains committed to investigating the causes of this within a positivist framework. 

- **Assumptions:** Liberal feminists believe that women’s equality can be achieved by removing legal and other obstacles that have denied them the same rights and opportunities as men.
- **Methodological preferences:** Liberal feminists use gender as an explanatory variable in foreign-policy analysis
- **Exemplary writings:** Mary Caprioli and Mark Boyer use statistical indicator to investigate whether there is a relationship between domestic gender equality and states' use of violence internationally
    - Result: Violence decrease as domestic gender equality increase
    - Critique from postpositivist: There is problem with measuring gender inequality using statistical indicators, must go deeper than this.

### Critical feminism - [[Critical Theory\|Critical Theory]]

- **Assumptions:** Ideas are the product of human agents. Therefore, there is possibility of change. Critical theory is committed to understanding the world in order to try to change it.
- **Methodological preferences:** Goes beyond liberal feminism's use of gender as a variable. It explores the ideational and material manifestations of gendered identities and gendered power in global politics
- **Exemplary writings:**
    - Sandra Whitworth: *Feminism and International Relations* - Examines he different ways gender was understood over time
    - Christine Chin's: *In Service and Servitude* - examines the increasing prevalence of underpaid and often exploited foreign female domestic workers in Malaysia during 1970

### Feminist constructivism - [[Constructivism\|Constructivism]]

- **Assumptions:**  Ideas about gender shape and are shaped by global politics
- **Methodological preferences:** ideas about womanhood and femininity
- **Exemplary writings:**
    - Elisabeth Prugl: *The Global Construction of Gender* - analyze the treatment of homebased work in international negotiation and international law.

### Feminist poststructuralism - [[Post-Structuralism\|Post-Structuralism]]

- **Assumptions:  Poststructuralist feminism** is particularly concerned with the way dichotomized linguistic 
constructions, such as strong/weak, rational/emotional, and public/private, serve to empower 
the masculine over the feminine. They believed that these distinctions have real world consequences
- **Methodological preferences:** Feminist poststructuralists seek to expose and deconstruct these hierarchies—often 
through the analysis of texts and their meaning.
- **Exemplary writings:**
    - Charlotte Hooper: *Manly States* - what role does international relations theory and practice 
    play in shaping, defining, and legitimating masculinities
    - Laura Shepherd: *Gender, Violence, and Security*

### Postcolonial feminism - [[Post-Colonialism\|Post-Colonialism]]

- **Assumptions:**  Postcolonial feminists see false claims of universalism arising 
from knowledge which is based largely on the experiences of relatively privileged Western women.
- **Methodological preferences:** Culture, social class, race and geographical location
- **Exemplary writings:**
    - Chandra Mohanty: criticize some Western feminists for treating women as a homogeneous category
    - Lily Ling and Annathangelou: seek to redress these subordinations within their own cultural context, rather than through some universal understanding of women’s needs
