# Introduction

ASEAN created during the Cold War 1967

Why: to maintain conflict between the democratic and socialist blocks. 

> Contain communism in Southeast Asia
> 

Concern of ‚áí less autonomy

- Communistic powers
- Concern of America interference on SEA countries ‚áí

Post-Cold War: 

- Less concern of security ‚áí focus on economic and cooperation
- Expansion of membership (Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar)
- New concern of China influence/rise to hegemony
    
    China might want SEA countries to switch from capitalist to socialistic practices
    

## ASEAN Two Levels of IR

### a. The Bilateral Level


ü§ù ASEAN state< = > ASEAN state
ASEAN < = > Non-ASEAN



Bilateral Relations is needed because of national interests, but it undermines Multilateral Relations

Countries can select their partners more carefully without the burden of smaller member countries.

### b. The Multilateral Level


ü§ù ASEAN members < = > ASEAN
All ASEAN 10 members < = > Non-ASEAN/IOs



Multilateral Relations helps smaller ASEAN members get trade agreements and relations with a bigger voice (ASEAN)

## ASEAN Centrality

2007 Charter

- To have many relations and connections in the international community with ASEAN as the Chair
- To stop bilateral relations from conflicting with one another ‚áí as a central point for trades
    
    Cooperate with trade partners using ASEAN methods to stop conflicts
    

# Post-Cold War in Southeast Asia

interests switch to

- ASEAN integration in globalization
- China rising power
- Regional power competition

Due to uncertainty of US and Japan's reaction to rise of China

‚áí ASEAN Centrality with multilateral diplomacy

bilateral and multilateral relations undermines ASEAN's Centrality

# Political Interests of ASEAN

Western liberal democracy spreaded in Post-Cold War due to collapse of Socialism

Western civil and political rights still not integrated in ASEAN due to ASEAN Values

China constraints on democratization and encourages authoritarian


ü§ù Diversity of ASEAN(rich/poor) makes the need for bilateral relations
ASEAN members are small and less influential cannot act as central of international trades.



## Traditional Threats in SEA

- SEA interstate conflicts has decreased: minor conflicts
- Increase in super power conflict for domination
- Conflict with China: South China Sea

## Non-Traditional Threats in SEA

- base of terrorist groups operations
- Illegal trade, human trafficking
- Outbreak of contagious disease
- Natural Disasters


ü§¥ ASEAN cannot deal with it's internal problems therefore cannot act as chair of International Trade



# Economic Interests of ASEAN

- Growing importance of the region for economy
- Rich potential resources (Myanmar, Laos)
- NIS (export-led)
    
    More export than imports ‚áí better comparative advantage‚áí Economic Growth
    
    - Countries
        
        Indonesia
        
        Malaysia
        
        Singapore
        
        Thailand
        
        Vietnam
        
        Philippines
        
- Many regional mechanisms (trade agreements...)
