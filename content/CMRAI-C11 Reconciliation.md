    💡 Ex: [[Khmer Rouge\|Khmer Rouge]] Tribunal
    
    
    
- **Retributive Justice**: legal procedures to search for prosecution and punishment
    - Judge panel
    - Instead of procedural justice, reparation policies aim for compensatory justice
    - Restorative justice allows offenders the opportunity to accept and be accountable for their acts

# Restitution and Reparation

- Reparation: societal restoration through apology
    
    
    💡 Ex: Government apology in Australia for the aborigines as “Sorry Day”
    
    
    
- Restitution: material resources such as financial & economic
    - Restoration of seized lands, properties, belongings, and possessions
- End of War: victor unilaterally impose its terms of restitution on the defeated
    
    
    💡 **Could cause problem**: WW1 → WW2: [[Nazi-Germany\|Nazi-Germany]] revolted because the pressure
    
    - WW2: seizing weapons and military instead of finance
