Post-colonist SEA states remain connected to their former colonial rulers through subsistence agriculture

    ‚áí **Export-led Industrialization:** produce products locally and export for more profit
    
- 1980s, SEA ASEAN's tigers were still small compared to the rest of Asia (China, Japan...)

# I. Intra-ASEAN Regionalism and ASEAN Free Trade Area

## 1. Intra-ASEAN Regionalism

- 1967, Bangkok Declaration, formation of ASEAN for economic cooperation.
- 1976, ASEAN Bali Summit called for industrialization through
    - Market sharing: ?
    - Resource pooling: Sharing resource among members
    - Regional preferential tariffs: reduce trade barriers in the region
- ASEAN Industrial Joint Venture (AIJV), objected by Malaysia (have own automotive industry)

### Lack of Integration

1983, report on ASEAN Cooperation says ASEAN members: 

- no intrastate objective
- had no political will
- is self-interested

‚áí 1986, after 19 years still ASEAN members didn't trust one another

## 2. ASEAN Free Trade Area

**1992 Singapore Summit**: first ever ASEAN talk about economic cooperation

- AFTA ran by Common Effective Preferential Tariffs
    - *Effective:* 1st Jan 1993
    - *Target*: of lowering tariff levels 0-5 %
    - CLMV joined and had later deadline to comply with AFTA
- AFTA Plus
    - ASEAN Framework Agreement in Services (AFAS): foreign services locally
        
        1995
        
        - Hospitals
        - Banks
        - Agencies
    - ASEAN Investment Area (AIA): fairly treat foreign investors to stimulate flow of investment
        
        Created: 1995
        
        Applies for both ASEAN members and non-ASEAN members
        
        - Tax exemption
    - ASEAN Industrial Cooperation (AICO): to manage taxation levels of imports
        
        1996
        
    - Problem of
        - how to harmonize the Six and CLMV economies
        - Diversity of banking, tax, regulations, judicial systems, corruptions

## 3. The External Impetus

ASEAN concerned over competition for FDI against fast growing China

- Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
    
    Created: 1989
    
    Aim: promote cooperation in Pacific Rim countries to influence dominant powers
    
    First Meeting: Blake Island 1993
    
- Bogor Declaration:
    
    Created: 1995
    
    Aim: for developed countries to open their economies by 2010, and developing countries by 2020
    

## 4. The Clash of 1997

China and Japan devaluated their currencies ‚áí their products are cheaper than SEA

- SEA financial crisis 1997
- IMF support program (billions) with conditional reforms: for changes in behavior by countries
    - Only Malaysia Rejected: Mahathir paranoid about external interference

ASEAN had no financial institution to deal with financial crisis

### Regional Response

- ASEAN approved Japan's 100 billion assistance for no condition
    
    ASEAN looked East ‚áí ASEAN+3 (China, Japan, South Korea)
    
- The 2000 Chiang Mai Initiative linking ASEAN to China, South Korea, and Japan
- After financial crisis, ASEAN Surveillance Process created for monitoring and sharing info about financial issues

### Pattern of ASEAN Trade and Investment

- ASEAN wanted economic integration to
    - expand trade
    - attract investment
- ASEAN recovered from 1997 financial crisis
- ASEAN is concerned over the West market as China was rising
    - China has cheaper labor
    - ASEAN relied on outside markets more than among themselves

Inequality between market of the Six and CLMV

- No institution to promote trust among members
- Competition by CLMV to reduce wealth gap

# Economic Regionalism Beyond AFTA

ASEAN intends to promote deeper regional integration

ASEAN views the West protectionism a threat to it's expansion

- Trump's focus on unemployment "America First"
- ASEAN pursing both (depending on differing interests)
    - FTA through bilateral agreement
    - RTA through multilateral agreement


üçú "Noodle Bowl" different lack of uniform rules of trades that compete with one another making prices higher for consumers



ASEAN strong relation with ASEAN+3

## Trade Implication with Politics

- China pursues dominant position with East Asia Free Trade Area
- Japan against China's influence with Comprehensive Economic Partnership in East Asia
- Obama's US opposed closed regionalism, advocated Free Trade Agreement of Asia Pacific against China
- Trump's US imposed protectionism ‚áí Trade War with China
- Global supply chain may shift out of China after Coronavirus

# Conclusion

3 Stages of ASEAN's Economic Cooperation

- The import substitution industrialization
- The export-led industrialization
- Regional Economic Integration

ASEAN's economic integration relied on FTA and RTA with the weakness of `"noodle bowl"`

- Weak institution for cooperation and regulation for rules of common good
- Undermines ASEAN regional influence as members are absorbed into China's and US's framework

ASEAN has to adapt to the post coronavirus new world order

# Discussion Questions

1. Explain ASEAN economic evolution since post-independence to current day.
2. ASEAN has desire for regional integration but ASEAN's economic outward looking method undermine ASEAN's integrations efforts.
3. How does coronavirus and US-China Trade War implicate the ASEAN trade prospect in the future?
    - Foreign imports in US is taxed (protectionism)
    - US retract businesses/Companies from China from both Coronavirus and Trade War
    
    Positive: more foreign companies into SEA from China
    
    Negative: US's protectionism impacting market accessibility from SEA
