# Learn about a topic by exposing yourself to it at every angle

- if you have to read articles about a certain topic before a lecture. 
	- make sure to engross yourself into the topic. 
	- consume all types of contents that involve it, no matter podcasts, YouTube videos, web articles, research papers
- organize it in your mind before you can explore it fully with the help of the lecturer during their lecture.
