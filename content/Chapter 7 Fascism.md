# Chapter 7: Fascism

# 1. Preview

Fascism: idea of an organically unified national community "Strength through Unity"

- Individual Identity is absorbed into community
- A 'new man' or 'hero' is one who dedicates his life to the glory of his nation/race.

Two Traditions

- Italian Fascism: absolute loyalty towards totalitarian state
- Nazism: Anti-semitism/racism

# 2. Origin and Development

First appeared between WW1 & WW2

Against the idea of the Enlightenment

Ex: 

- Nazi Germany: "1789 is Abolished"
- Fascists Italy: "Believe, Obey, Fight" & "Order, Authority, Justice"

## 2.1. Taking It's First Shape

19th century most ideas and doctrines existed but not popular

Fascism popularized after WW1

Italy: One-party fascist state by Benito Mussolini, March on Rome

Nazi: National Socialist German Workers' Party under Adolf Hitler

Most of Europe got Democracy over turned + Outside (Japan, Argentina)

Fascism came from a number of variables between [[World War 1\|World War 1]]  & [[World War 2\|World War 2]] 

- Many young democratic governments in Europe
- Democratic governments appear weak on international level in economic/political crises
- Industrialization threatened lower middle class

# 3. Fascism and the State

Extreme Statism: idea of all powerful/totalitarian state

Extreme Racism: one race is superior to other races

## 3.1. The Totalitarian Ideal

Popular during Cold War

Totalitarianism became a symbol of anti-communist view

Generic Fascism usually is totalitarian in 3 aspects

- Creation of a 'fascist man', loyal, dedicated, and obedient man to the state (no individualism)
    - The good of state > The good of individuals
- Leader with unlimited authority
- Monism: believing on a single value system, one source of truth

> ‘Everything for the state; nothing against the state; nothing outside the state.’
> 

Nazi Germany came closer to to realizing the totalitarian ideal in practice than did the Mussolini regime.

## 3.2. Corporatism

- Corporatism's Assumption is: Business and labor are bound together and can work together for national interests.
    - To heavily incorporate organized interests into the processes of government
- fascists sought to transform human consciousness rather than social structures
- Corporatism was the 'third way' or an alternative to both capitalism and socialism, denying elements from both sides
    - Capitalist's Free Market: leads to unrestrained pursuit of profit
    - Central Planning: leads to class war

### 3.2.1. Authoritarian Corporatism

an ideology and economic reform closely linked with Fascist Italy

- Ideology: alternative to capitalism and socialism based on holism and group integration
- Economic Reform: government's direct political control over industry and organized labor.

Strengthen Government

### 3.2.2. Liberal Corporatism

A nature found in mature liberal democracies where companies are granted and institutionalized access to policy formulation.

Strengthen Groups

## 3.3. Modernization

Mussolini and Italian Fascists saw states as an agent of modernization

All other forms of Fascism are backward-looking, highlighting glories of the past

Italian fascism was forward-looking

- Futurism: a movement that glorifies industrial life, factories, and machines, and the rejection of the past

# 4. Fascism and Racism

Not all fascists are racists, not all racists are fascists

Italian Fascism was a voluntaristic form of fascism, where it could embrace people regardless of diversity.

Fascism and Racism

- has come from racist ideas
- emphasize militant nationalism: the action of starting wars to achieve their goals

## 4.1. The Politics of Race

Race cannot be changed or decided. But it's used to reflect cultural stereotypes 

- Blacks as criminals
- Muslims as terrorists

Core assumption of racism:

- Political and social conclusion can be drawn from difference between races in the world

### Racist association with conservative nationalism

Stable and successful society must be bound together by a common culture and shared values.

Therefore, 'non-whites' were banned from entering European nations as it threatens 'white' cultures

### Religion Based Racism

- In the 19th Century, the Christian peoples were thought of as 'superior' over the 'heathens' of Africa and Asia.
- The Ku Klux Klan also got their justification from the bible

### Racism based on Quasi-science

Nazi Germany claims inescapable nature of people that are supposedly backed up by scientific beliefs.

## 4.2. Nazi Race Theories

Anti-Semitism existed before Nazi Germany, from religious beliefs that Jews are evil because:

- Jews were responsible for Jesus Christ's death
- Jews were denying the divinity of Jesus by not converting to Christianity

19th Century, Racial Theory: pseudo-scientific ideas used for social and political issues

- Defined Jews as a degraded race, rather than a culture group

### First Scientific Theory of Racism

$\tiny{by}$ Joseph-Arthur Gobineau

There is a ranking of races

- Aryans: are white people who are the most developed and creative
- Jewish: are uncreative

He was pessimistic, saying that intermarriage had progressed so far that the glorious Aryans civilization had already been corrupted beyond repair.

---

### Nazi Race Theory

Nazism presented the Germans as the force of 'good' while the Jews as the force of 'evil' and divided the world's races into three:

- Aryans: were the master race, 'the founders of cultures', and responsible of all the world's creativity.
- Bearers of Culture: people, incapable of creativity, who use ideas and inventions by the Germans
- Jews: the 'destroyers of culture' who conflict against nobles and Aryans.

### [[Genocide\|Genocide]]

As the 'master-race' Nazis took on expansionism and war

- Germans were superior biologically, therefore they wanted world domination
- Germany cannot be secured as long as Jews exists, therefore 6 million Jews were persecuted and eventually killed.

## 4.3. Peasant ideology

Italian Fascism: embraced the modernizing force and the benefits of industry and technology

German Fascism: had a distinctively anti-modern philosophy, sees modern technology as decadent and corrupt

Nazi viewed Germans as

- to have simple existence
- to live close to the land

Industrialization and urbanization undermined the German spirit and weakened racial stock.

Impact on politics:

- The concept of Lebensraum: only territorial expansion will enable Germans to have the peasant experience

Hitler started rapid industrialization however (opposite to Nazism)

- Nazism's peasant ideology turned into rhetoric
- Nazism stayed on peasant ideology but Germans are shown modern technological weapons all the time.

# 5. Fascism in a global age

Most would say Fascism all ended after world war 2 with the suicide of Hitler.

After the Cold War, globalization strengthened right wing extremists to draw on fear of immigration weakening national identity.

- Yugoslavia: re-emerged racial hatred, extreme nationalism with fascist type features
- Some form of religious fascism as 'Islamo-fascism'

But current day, fascism doesn't exist anymore

- Far right anti-immigration groups have different roots and challenges
- Multiculturalism in Europe is so divers it's impossible to create a pure national community
- traditional class division of fascism replaced with complex and pluralized post-industrial social formations
- Economic globalization made national borders less important and expansionism unlikely

Modern Fascism

- underground, illegal groups still have the same militant revolutionary fascism of Hitler or Mussolini
- Larger parties says they were either never Fascists or to have broken off from fascist ideology
    - Neo-fascism: fascism broken from absolute leadership, totalitarianism, and overt racism
    
    After WW2, European countries. Like earlier fascist movements, neofascism advocated extreme nationalism, opposed liberal individualism, attacked Marxist and other left-wing ideologies, indulged in racist and xenophobic scapegoating, and promoted populist right-wing economic programs. Unlike the fascists, however, neofascists placed more blame for their countries’ problems on non-European immigrants than on leftists and Jews. They make concerted efforts to portray themselves as democratic and “mainstream.
