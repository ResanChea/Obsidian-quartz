### Summary of main points

1.  An essay isn't a collage of past researchs' arguments glued together into a paper. 
2.  The simpler you word your argument the better you understand the point you're making. Stop using thesaurus.

### Highlights and Notes

- Essay writing should be about the process of trying to figure something out new with the info you already have
- An essay is a pooling of past information for consuming and relating into one key idea that is new and connected to the info you learned, while using the pool if researches as your evidence.
- Lecturers are easily able to know you don't know what you're talking about especially if you use unnessesarily difficult words
    - Technical words are only used to hide your inability to explain it easier.
    - Richard Fienman is right
- Don’t be afraid to poke at a seemingly stupid idea: the easily thought of ideas are ones that are already thought of and won’t be interesting to explore
