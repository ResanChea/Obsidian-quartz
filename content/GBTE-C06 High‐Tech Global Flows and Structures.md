# GBTE-C06: High‐Tech Global Flows and Structures

# How have high‐tech flows changed the nature of time and space?

- **Time–Space Compression**: The shrinking of space and the reduction of the time required by a wide range of processes, brought about by changes in transportation and communication technologies advanced mainly by capitalist corporations (globalization)
- How is time-space compressed?
    - Newspapers → Social Medias: facilitate global flow of info
    - Seamless transport of container: ships $\leftrightarrow$ truck $\leftrightarrow$ train $\leftrightarrow$ plane

    	b-->c[["Train"]]
    	c-->d("Plane")
    	d-->a
    ```
    
    - Technological development in commerce: reaching many with little effort
    - global Internet transactions and the coordination of global value chains
        - global corporations coordinating with overseas branches
- **Time–Space Distanciation**: The stretching of social relations across space and time, brought about by technological change.
    - transportation & communication technology improving interpersonal relations across far distances
    - But high-tech flow can be an assistance rather than a replacement to physical relations
        - People remain situated in their local environment
        - Some social media helps connect people IRL
- Space Based Technologies
    - Fear that a war over space could devastate the world
    - GPS system is crucial to the world
    - Compress distance between people and space
        
        
        💡 Ex: Virgin Galactic, Space-X, Blue Origin: commercializing space travel
        
        
        
- Robotics
    - Replacing automobile assembly lines: more efficient than humans
    - Replacing waiters & counter-staffs
    - AI Replacing skilled white-collar workers
    - IT development is pushing us to a tipping point of less labor intensive global economy
- Economic Impacts
    - Increased productivity
    - Trade/investment
    - Market expansion
- **Leapfrogging**: developing nations bypassing earlier technologies and adopting more advanced ones (narrowing economic gaps due to globalization)
    - community without electricity can skip it for generators, going straight to mobile devices
    - Some might skip generators in general and use only solar panels
    - Problem: leapfrogging lacks basic 20th century infrastructure to make it available to mass public and not just a few
    - Rich countries, through IP, protect their developments from spreading to developing states

# What is media imperialism? How do global flows of technology affect it?

- World was dominated by Western media
- Media Imperialism: western dominated media monopolizes spread of information
    - Non-Western countries can’t express their own voice or arguments
- New Media: Due to globalization media technology is spreading and allowing voice for non-western countries
    - Decline in media imperialism
    - Multiple sources of information, reporting, cross-reference, multiple POV

# Discuss the impact of global technological flows on the nation-state.

- Political Impacts: spread of modern tech help increase the soft power of smaller states
    - Every state has a voice and is hearable: int’ conferences, UN, talk shop forums, self-publication internet
- High tech innovation encourage small states to compete
    - Key component of power now is digital technology: internet presence, cybersecurity
    
    
    💡 Ex: China’s dominance over 5G technology
    
    - Spread it to other countries
    - China will control lots of info
    
    
- Spill-over of technology competition into military tension/conflict
    - Cybersecurity, China US competition over internet
- Creates State vs People tension due to high-tech
    - Great Firewall of China or Censorship
    - Education

# Notes

- How would this apply to Cambodia’s case of spread of modern technology?
