# Introduction

After WW2: Paradigm shift from state to human security.

Cold War & WW2 shift of focus for leaders to protect people

# I. Human Needs and Human Security

**What is Human Security?**

|1994, New Dimension on Human Security: The twin basic goals:

- Freedom of Want: provide basic needs for people to survive
- Freedom from Fear: states' respect of human rights, freedom to criticize...

Critics say it need to address both national and international issues???

UN says Threat on Human Security are economic and social factors

- Poverty, disease, employment, living standard, gender inequality...

|2003, UN Secretary General Commission report

**Human Security**: stressed protecting and empowering the people

- Ban suppressive acts
- Free and fair election for citizen power to control who lead the state

**Problem**:

- Of Implementation human rights protection internationally (authoritarianism...)

## **The UN Millennium Development Goals**

• Eliminate extreme hunger and poverty;
• Achieve universal primary education;
• Promote gender equality and empower women;
• Reduce child mortality;
• Improve maternal health;
• Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases;
• Ensure environmental sustainability; and
• Develop a global partnership for development.

Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand on track to 2015 target

Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Philippines falling behind

Cambodia and Timor-Lest out of the race

| Countries | 2006 | 2015 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Singapore | 25 | 11 |

| Malaysia | 63 | 62 |
| Lao | 141 | 141 |

| Myanmar | 132 | 148 |
- Governance and Human Development defined by the UN
    - The government must have political will and capacity to promote social economic policies for public goods with fairly and uniformly for all of the population
    - Political will is not necessary for democratic states but is key for good governance
    - **Corruption** is main obstacle to human rights
    - UN and Int' community can't deal with authoritarian regimes, sanctions hurt vulnerable civilians instead
    - China's soft power of economy still able to practice authoritarianism

## Human Security and the Vulnerable Groups

### Refugees in SEA

- Cambodia civil war, genocide, different changes of regimes, dictatorship
- During Cold War: Vietnam pushed Chinese refugees out (fear of security)
- Myanmar: repressive against ethnic groups

### Migrant Labor

|2007: ASEAN Declaration on the Protection of the Rights of Migrant Labor

Bilateral agreements promise no guarantee of protection. No political will

### Humanitarian Relief

External Assistance from developed countries (+UN&NGOs): Tsunami, Typhon

### Pandemic Disease

HIV/AIDS, SARS, Avian Flu, and COVID-19

# Human Rights and Human Security

**ASEAN's position on Human Rights**:

- ASEAN signed the 1954 Human Charter with the 1958 Universal Declaration of Human Rights
    
    Promising to uphold human rights
    
- 2003: ASENA adopted the Declaration of Human Rights
- Human Rights constrained by ASEAN Way
- US & EU effective in seeking HR in ASEAN: through Sanctions
- NGOs: Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch: monitoring human  rights internationally

**Regional View of Human Rights**

ASEAN Leaders view human rights and freedom as a western concept.

Economic, social, and cultural rights are more important for "human dignity and individual achievement"

Belief in hierarchical system of higher and lower position of each individual

1993 Vietnna Declaration states even if theres differences in economic, social and cultural factors, States still have the duty to provide human rights  to everyone

- CLMV opposed human rights being in ASEAN Charter
- US and EU pressures ASEAN on Myanmar's human rise issue

## Past Crimes Against Humanity in SEA

- Cambodia: The Khmer Rouge
- Indonesia: suppression and killing of Timor-leste

# Conclusion

More focus on individual security and human security

from past traumatic events for civilians in wars of 20th century

## ASEAN Human Rights Situation Remain Poor

- ASEAN Leaders see HR as western idea
- Member states still hold authoritarianism, plagued with corruption, injustice, and HR violations
