### Participants
- Too strict criteria could limit legitimacy of your conference/agreement
- Who should you invite?
	- Open to all: may be better

### Agenda
- The ordering of topics or existence of certain topics in the agenda could benefit some, but not other states.
- Should have vague agenda items
- Negative: could be used for bias and politically

### Format
- Public
	- Promote transparency and trust
	- But status use publicity to advertise propaganda, show strength, instead of cooperating
- Private
	- To give concessions without losing face to public
	- Problem: states could veto/object without public backlash
		- Only if private conferences doesn't work, then use mixed format
- Mixed Format: ==what is it???==
