# Theory

is a set of concepts that ties together logically. ទ្រឺស្ដី

reasonable propositions or statements about how the physical
and social world operates.

# Concept

is a mental abstraction to explain what something is. បញ្ញតិ

It's the opposite of a concrete idea that is seeable and right in front of us.

We measure a concept's concreteness by looking at Variables.

Ex: Giving $\color{lightblue}\small\boxed{land}$ to the $\color{lightblue}\small\boxed{landless}$ will contribute to reduce $\color{lightblue}\small\boxed{poverty}$

# Methods of Generating Knowledge

Theory

$\downarrow\uparrow$

Hypothesis: statement or assumption about the relationship between variables.

The more $\small\boxed{\text{land}}$  you have the $\small\boxed{\text{richer}}$ you are.

$\downarrow\uparrow$ 

Observation

??

## Deductive Research

from theory to connected variables to observation.

- Quantitative approach
- Using numerical data

## Inductive Research

from observation to connecting varaibles to a theory.

- Qualitative approach
- Using innitial images and appearance
