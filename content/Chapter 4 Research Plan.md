**Content**

---

Every research project shows the same content headers

- Measurement
- Sampling
- Data collection Techniques
- Research Plan etc.

# 1. The Research Plan

## 1.1. Coming up with the Right Question

Research Questions must be

- Researchable: the question must be answerable
- Interesting: to be 'green-lit' by funders, the research must attract attention
    - Resolving conflictual research debate topic
    - Extend research questions more inadept
    - Using new methodology
    - Address a knowledge gap

---

## 1.2. Reviewing the Literature

Review past relevant research literature on the topic being researched

- to see how past-researchers approached the topic
- to see how effective their research questions were
- to guide on vocab usage, data collection method...

---

To start researching a new topic you must catch up on past findings.

You must narrowly scope your questions to be able to consume all the past research available.

---

**On a broad subjects**

- You read titles and abstracts to get the basics
- Then insert specific term to narrow the scope

---

## 1.3. The Case and Place for Theory

- The question must have theoretical connection to the topic to be interesting
    
    |Create a theory that can be tested against Empirical evidence
    
- The question must have a purpose for being asked, and how it contributes to the research
- Topic must not be abstract as to not able to be tested by empirical evidence

---

Therefore

The "middle-range theory" is the goal for a research to be at.

|For empirical evidence to repeatedly confirm the theoretical ideas.

---

# 2. The Placement of Theory in the Research Process

## 2.1. Deductive Research

where data collection is the starting point to forming a theory

Empirical generalizations – generalizations based on or drawn from observed patterns in the data.

---

Look for patterns in the collected empirical evidence 

- Strengthen what is already known from empirical generalization
- Then generate a corresponding theoretical idea

## 2.2. Inductive Research

Definition: where the theory is used as a start for data collection

---

Propositions or hypotheses derived from the theory to be tested with empirical data.

The test will either:

- support/reject the hypothesis
- strengthen/challenge the original theory

---

# 3. The Levels of Theory Guiding or Resulting from Researchhere the theory is used as a start for data collecti

## 3.1. Macro Theory

Are theories having a broader scale in explaining social processes or institutions

Ex: Macro-economic studies an entire country's:

- Unemployment
- Trends
- Productivity

---

## 3.2. Micro Theories

Are theories focusing on narrower scope involving smaller slices of social reality

Ex: Micro-economics focus on behavior of specific individuals or businesses

---

## 3.3. Meso-level Theory

It tries to merge macro- and micro-level in an intermediate level of theoretical explanation

It focuses more on groups or formal organizations

---

## 3.4. Paradigms

Paradigms are framework of thought that gives very broad views of how the world works. It makes assumptions and methods for understanding the world.

---

### 3.4.1. Order Paradigm (Macro)

The world is consensus-based orderly arrangement of social institutions that compliment each other, making a smooth social system.

Concepts: social solidarity, social stability, social integration, collective conscience

---

### 3.4.2. Conflict Paradigm (Macro)

The world is a non-consensus place and any sense of order comes from power and coercion.

Concepts: coercion, power, force, special interests

---

### 3.4.3. Symbolic-interactionist Paradigm (Micro)

The order around us are result of interactions and negotiations between people in society

Concepts: impression management, social context, verbal and non-verbal communication

---

# 4. Causal vs. Non-Causal Question

## Causal Question

Is to ask if something is the cause of something else.

The experimental design: to manipulate independent variables and observe for changes

- Experimental Group: exposed to the independent variable
- Control Group: not exposed to the independent variable
- Random Assignment [^1]: equal chance to end up in control group or experimental group.

---

## Non-Causal Question

Non-Causal Questions uses Cross sectional design: 'What' questions that pursue

- description/Explorative
- correlational analysis
- exploration or evaluation
- process or change

Non-experimental research designs: (survey)

- Cross-sectional design
- Longitudinal Design
- Examples
    - Survey description of population
    - Social Process: sex-change, terrorist-recruitment
    - Impact of social programs/policies
    - Social Change

---

# 5. Timing

Research might want data to be in a specific moment in time or to be for change over time.

### 5.1. Cross-Sectional Research Design

Is to collect data at a moment in time

Data collection happens through surveys

Used for:

- Social Research: people's behavior and thought
- Correlational Analysis: associations between variables in society or social process

---

### 5.2. Longitudinal Research Design

Analysis of change over time. It collects data at 2 or more points in time. (Wave of study)

Change happens at 2 basic levels:

- Individual level: requires fixed sample panel design
- "Higher" group or social level: repeated cross-sectional design of differing samples

---

**Fixed-Sample Panel Design**

Used look for change in the individual level of analysis

Data (survey) is collected from the same sample of respondents at multiple points in time.

---

It's difficult to execute, why?

- Task of Tracking People: people inform their friends and family about their whereabouts, but not researchers.
- Panel Mortality: subjects drop participation half way through

---

**Repeated Cross Sectional Design**

data (survey) collected at two or more points in time from different samples of the same research population each time

It can measure change in population, but not individuals overtime

**Cautions**

- Fair sample the representation of the same population on each wave
- Consistency in the measurement process, same survey questions...

---

**Event-Based Design**

Data (survey) collected of change in cohorts who share a defining event.

Cohort: people defined by the same event. (Boomers)

---

# 6. Field Research

Research about processes requires qualitative research plans for Fieldwork

- Field Workers: are Researchers meet subjects and gather details about their process
- Intensive/unstructured interview: is hands on research in the subject's natural habitat

---

# 7. Validity

## 7.1. Measurement Validity

Selection of key variables that most relevant to the research topic

- Concepts could be turned into measurable variables
- Out of the possible measures in the project, pick ones that most accurately define causation in the research
- Literature Review past variable choices and their effectiveness, could help with choosing variables

---

## 7.2. Internal Validity

To select the appropriate strategy of action to the research agenda

Ex: Research of Causal Analysis must use Experimental designs are the best for isolating the cause and effect relationship and thus are strongest for achieving internal validity.

---

## 7.3. External Validity

Ensure the generalizability of the research findings by carefulness in sampling procedures

How?

- Probability Sampling: individuals are selected by RNG without biases from the population.
- Experimental Design: fails to replicate real life, out of lab experiences (mundane realism)
    
    ⇒ to gain external validity the experiment must be repeated with different conditions to see if the finding holds
    

---

# Conclusion

- A theory will direct research in selecting concepts, variables, and hypotheses or questions.
- Specifying research question to decide between experimental or non-experimental design
- Plan for time specific or change over time data collection, longitudinal or cross sectional
- Validity of measurement, internal, and external brings trust in the research

3 Main Research Desing

- Experimental Design
- Cross-sectional Design
- Field Research
