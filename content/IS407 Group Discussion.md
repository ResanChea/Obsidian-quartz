**The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights** is a multilateral treaty that commits states parties to respect the civil and political rights of individuals, including the right to life, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, electoral rights and rights to due process and a fair trial.

**Major rights:**

- Essentially, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights expands those rights enshrined in **Arts 1–21** of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (the right to life)
- **The prohibition on slavery and torture (Arts 7-8)**
- Deprivation of liberty through detention and the rights of an accused to a fair trial
- **The right to move freely throughout the territory (Arts 12-13)**
- **The freedom of thought, conscience, and religion (Art 20)**
- **Assembly and association is prescribed with restriction only possible in accordance with the law and where necessary in a democratic society (Arts 21–2)**
- **Children are to be protected as befits their minor status (Art 24)**
- Democratic rights of participation in government
- **The right of ethnic, religious, or linguistic minorities to enjoy their culture, profess and practice their religion, and use their own language (Art 27)**

**Implementation:**  Compliance with the ICCPR is monitored by the United Nations Human Rights Committee, which reviews regular reports of states parties on how the rights are being implemented. States must report one year after acceding to the Covenant and then whenever the Committee requests (usually every four years).

- Human Rights Committee was established by the Covenant
- State parties submit reports to the Committee on the measures they have adopted which give effect to the rights recognized in the Covenant and on the progress made in the enjoyment of those rights within their jurisdiction

Art 41 of the Covenant enables States to declare, at any time, their recognition of the competence of the Committee to receive and consider any communications to the effect that the State concerned is not fulfilling its obligations under the Covenant.
