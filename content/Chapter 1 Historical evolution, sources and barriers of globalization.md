- Globalization Coined in second half of 20th century
- 15th century: 'Globe' came from Latin
    - later defined the world as a sphere
- Global circulated in 17th century and added the meaning of 'world scale' in 19th century
- Globalize and Globalism appeared in 1940s
- Globalization first used in 1959, in dictionary in 1961
    - Was not popular during the Cold War but did after
- Globality circulated in the 1980s

## 1.1. Briefly illustrate the popularity of the term ‚Äúglobalization‚Äù.

- It became popular in recent decades
    - got translated to many languages
    - ideas of globalization it appeared independently in different fields roughly at the same time (1980s) in Sociology, Business, International Relations, Economist, Geographers
    - United States Library of Congress's mention of 'globalization' multiplied from 34 in 1994 to 5,245
    - Now its in education, main concern of global conferences

# 2. Why is a clear and precise definition of ‚Äúglobalization‚Äù necessary?

- When using the term Globalization, because it's popular, while not knowing what it clearly means it can be dangerous
    - If you have a negative understanding of Globalization you could be put off from the benefits of globalization or the appeal of it in general (extremist terrorism, interdependence = weakness...)
- before globalization can be treated as a serious scholarly category, it must be properly have clear, precise, explicit, consistent and cogent conceptualization first.
- How to know what definition is good? criterias? not in the book.

## 2.1. What are the criteria of a meaningful definition? Briefly explain.


üí° Criterias of a good definition should

1. advance new knowledge, teach us something, to describe a new phenomenon, not rebrand an old concept
2. be as neutral as possible: to be accepted by most groups of people
3. relative to a context: should describe a new context instead of old one
4. not be fixed, should be dynamic, open to change
5. be clear, precise, explicit, consistent, and cogent: supported with empirical evidence


# 3. What are the weaknesses of the following definitions of ‚Äúglobalization‚Äù?

- Definition of Globalization through Internationalization, Liberalization, Universalization, and Westernization **are unoriginal**
    - Arguments that build on these conceptions fail to open insights that are not available through pre-existent vocabulary
    - People reject the novelty and transformative potential of globalisation in contemporary history because of these definitions
- These are the attempts to categorize definitions of Globalization into 4 types:

## 3.1. Globalization is internationalization.

- Some authors use internationalization and globalization as synonyms
- Globalization is a more intense form of globalization
    - 'old wine in new bottle' makes understanding the concept confusing, the subtle differences between each.
- Too state-centric
- weaknesses
    - Doesn't fit into all criterias of a good definition
    - too fixed: Have too small a scope, uninclusive
    - State centered, globalization = more actors

## 3.2. Globalization is liberalization.

- openness to liberal economy, capitalism, the westphalian model, removal of economic barriers
- weaknesses
    - too fixed: only refer to economic connections
    - no new knowledge: term already exist 'old wine in new bottle'
    - too biased: to neo-liberalism, removal of trade barriers,
        - liberal economic policy is not the only and perfect one

## 3.3. Globalization is universalization.

- The equality between ethnicity, people, nationality, the spread of sameness
    - Same actions, experiences, language, entertainment...
    - Homogenization, spread of culture/religion, practice diversity all over the world
- weaknesses
    - no new knowledge: redundant definition of very old concept, cosmopolitanism
    - too fixed: doesn't recognize politics

## 3.4. Globalization is westernization.

- Social structure of western modernity spread all over the world
    - connected with colonization
    - western dominated idea
- weaknesses
    - biased to western culture: they might not accept that therefore stay away from globalization
    - destroy other non-western cultures:

# 4. What is the 5th definition of ‚Äúglobalization‚Äù?

- The argument the author support over the earlier 4 definitions of globalization
- Globalization = **The supra-territorial/trans-planetary connection**: respatialization
    - space can influence all aspect of your lifestyle
    - trans-planetary: the conncetion exist and apply across the whole planet. Geography, global weather... that surpass border barriers
- There are 2 Different Spaces:
    - **Physical Space**: geographic characteristics, distance measurement
    - **Social Space**: The perception of ease of travel, communication, and closeness between people regardless of physical distance
- This definition says globalization made social spaces more connected.

### 4.1. Why does the author argue that this definition is the best of all? Briefly explain.

- It provides new insights: does not rely on old concepts to define new phenomenon.
    - New insights of Social Space, Trans-Planetary, Trans-Territorial
- It is more neutral: can be accepted by different groups of people
- It is open:
- It is relative to modern context: will apply to the future too
- It is cogent: traffic jams don't disconnect people much...


üí° Don't only use the 5th definition, use all and even the weak definitions according to context you're analyzing.

- Ex: use Globalization as liberalization for analyzing a country's economy.
- Use weaker/smaller scoped defintions of globalization to easier collect data and scope down topic of research


# 5. Differences between ‚Äúglobal‚Äù and ‚Äúworld, international, transnational‚Äù

- Global connection/globailty = Globalization
- World/International/Transnational connection ‚â† supra-territorial/trans-planetary connection
    - World connection isn't accurate, There are still borders (Countries, North/South...)
- Global Connection = Supra-territorial connection

# 6. Various instances of globality in the contemporary era

- Communication: online/telephone communication, broadcast medias/free-flow of information, online shopping+shipping
- Production: global supply chain, intermediary products,
- Military: world reaching weapons, ICMB, spread out military bases
- Law: Global law enforcement, arrests in different country than the crime

# 7. Major qualifications to the 5th definition of ‚Äúglobalization‚Äù?

(What cautions need to be taken when the 5th notion of ‚Äúglobalization‚Äù is applied?)

- **Qualification**: refers to the misperception/misunderstanding/exageration to avoid when thinking about globalization
- Different Misconceptions/Qualifications from the definition of Supra-territorial Connections
1. **Globalism**: those who support globalization
    - Their exagerated arguments of a borderless and fully globalized world
    - The world is in the process of globalizing and isn't borderless yet
        - Trans-border travel requires documentation and restrictions
        - Actors in a nation must still obey laws by government
2. **Reification**
    - Misperception: that 'Global, regional, national, local' products can be reified/separated. Each part of a product (phone) comes from different spaces
    - CorrectionThe product shouldn't be identified by all its different parts but as a whole
3. **Global/Local Binaries**
    - Misperception: thinking that Global things and Local things are arch enemies and does not complement one another.
        - Extremist Islam makes its thinking in destruction of all other's social structure
    - Correction: Global things + Local things both complement one another
        - To combine the good parts of Global things and the good parts of Local things to apply to the world
4. **Cultural Homogenization**
    - Misperception: a country must protect itself to keep one same identity from being lost.
    - Correction: a culture/identity can be a hybrid or should evolve overtime according to its context and accepting of foreign identity
        - A country's identity won't be lost but just evolves
        - Some traditional identity won't fit social context it requires foreign things (giving cola to monks)
5. **Universality ([[Cosmopolitanism\|Cosmopolitanism]])**
    - Misperception: every people is the same everywhere
    - Correction: thinking there's global equality means we give up on betterring wealth inequality, social injustices, racism...
        - **Glocalization**: the combination of globalization and localization. The application of local identity into a new foreign product.
        - People experience different interpretation/variation of the same branded things
6. **Political Neutrality**
    - Misperception: globalizations will benefit all people equally.
    - Correction: globalization will inequally affect people, negatively or positively according to geographic position
        - Governments should have redistribution efforts to make people more equally benefited by globalization

üí° **Policy makers** should look out for these misperceptions when defining what problems needs addressing and not have misperceptions about influences of globalization.
