# Conceptual Note Taking

- Conceptual note taking requires you to take notes directly into a variety of different documents about a concept each rather than into a mish-mash of a lecture note.
- Concepts are linked together like wikipedia links and are navigated likewise.
- It is better than [[Sequential Note Taking\|Sequential Note Taking]] because
    - Sequential note taking makes you write down things you learn then never see them again or thrown away
    - Conceptual Note Taking requires you to link notes to each other and most concepts are useful and required by many different subjects for years if not your whole life.
