# Feedback

forgot to set agenda

substance of the debate is not much

announce result of role call and votes, what is needed for things to be adopted

formal debate in opening speaker's list

next week no agenda setting

Speeches are over the 1 mn time limit

- if u hve more to say, just drop your name again

Speeches are only symbolic information to show what has been done and yourself has done. (speaker's list)

- speeches are only monologue giving of information instead of a debate
- Should be suspended pretty early on
- Open caucuses instead

In Caucus: should talk about proposals, solutions, objections to other's states' proposals 

Humanitarian issue has very similar proposals

When giving proposals you should provide evidence of why the issue is bad, why they should help

- use report papers

US should argue why we don't need troops there anymore

- use evidence and numbers

May 4, 2021 continue debate

2 moderated caucus to discuss and debate proposals

- unfinsihed or unraise issues
- new thought of proposals and debate
- economy?

end moderated caucus and start draft resolution

- prepare amendments
- focus on substance of draft resolution

look at your national interest

- if it goes against your interest amend or remove it
