# Socialism

## Assumptions

- **Class Politics**: Ideology in opposition to capitalism (Cooperation > Competition)
- **Common Ownership**: Everything belongs to the community, shared resources, and equally, not rich or poor
- **Equality**: You get the same amount no matter how much you contribute to society
- Less environmentally taxing than capitalism

## Problems

- State still is in the position of power (not equal)
- Contribution doesn't correlate with benefits means laziness and leeches
- Historical application of socialism has never succeeded
- Everyone as all strictly equal is wishful thinking

## Types of Socialism

- Revolutionist Socialism: remained the same, wanted to overthrow the government and change everything about society. (Communism)
- Reformists Socialism: switched to legal and constitutional methods of reform of the social & political system (Social Democracy/Socialism)
