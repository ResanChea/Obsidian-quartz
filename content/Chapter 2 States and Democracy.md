**To be discussed:**

Democracy: having mass public participate in political decisions

Hard to have everyone participate

- Elected representatives of people
- How accountable are they to the citizens
- Complications that must be resolved for a good democracy

# Why study states?

Increasing connectivity and amount of influential actors created by globalization has limited freedom of state to control it's own affairs.

- UN
- EU
- MNCs

## Should we pay less attention to states?

No, states are still sovereign in their own territory however limited.

- help with financial crisis
- get rid of genocide

## Why concentrate on democracies?

We can compare and contrast groups of similar states

Problem: Many democracies are Eruopean, Anglo-Saxon and North American 

- Over represented western countries

# The Modern States and Democracy

## How do you differentiate between democracies and non-democracies?

## 1. Citizen's rights

Human rights: right for everyone to free movement and self-determination

- speech & press
- religion & conscience
- assembly & association
- right to equal protection of law
- right to due process of law and to fair trail
- property rights to land, goods, and money

Rights allow people to **compete politically without consequences**

- there can be winners and losers in system of election

## 2. Election and parliamentary accountability

Representative democracy: democracy in which citizens elect leaders who govern in their name.

- consent of citizens
- selected and replaced according to citizens

# How did democratic states rise?

Non-democratic states still resist to share power but number of democracies are rising

- First half of 1900 to second half of 1950s â†’ 31% are living in democracies
- 21st century made even more democracies

Democracy value changes over time

- Democracy accepted as prefered way to organize states

# Redistribution and welfare states

As political freedom and democracy grows, the need of national identification by re-distributive policies also increase.

- Turns states into welfare states
- **collecting taxes and redistributing to the poor**

GDP per capital used to compare wealth between nations

States abandoned the [[Laissez-Faire\|laissez-faire]] policies and free-market after great depression

Public expenditure and revenue of states take up more and more of GDP

- To provide welfare for it's citizens
- Industrialized countries are hard to come back down in expenditures

# Theories of states and societies

Political theories about states

- Normative Theories: what state should do
- Empirical Theories: what states actually do and why

This section is about empirical theories

Four approaches to relations between state and society

## 1. State Supremacy

Etatism: means states have dominance over society and is independent of them

- Doesn't reflect characteristics of broader society
- Reducing of social and individual rights

### Debunk

Relation between state and society is mutually interdependent

- state influence society and mold it
- **society create state, give, and limit its powers**

## 2. State Dependency

State is dependent on society especially economics

[[Karl Marx\|Karl Marx]] : state is nothing more or less than a committee for managing the common affairs for **the dominant class**
{ #d38d8d}


- State is an instrument to strengthen power of capitalists

### Turning to interdependent one

Structural tension created by

- States supposed to protect free market to make profit but also to maintain social order and provide public services
    - Need to **tax businesses** to maintain society which reduces profit
- Increase in state activities: states perform lots of things but get little right

## 3. Inter-dependency

Society and state are mutually interdependent

- State very involved in social and economic regulations
- Society has become so complex it need state co-ordination for regulation and arbitration.

capitalists argue **mutual dependency between state and major economic interest groups**

- traditional variant: trade unions & employer associations negotiate directly with states about economic policies
- More variety of social groups making and implementing public policy of all kinds

## 4. Separation and autonomy

State and society are distinct and autonomous areas

- Social forces create social groups which cannot be regulated by state
- State cannot be captured by any interest or social class

For states to overstep these rules would be breach of democracy
