### Summary of main points

1. Techniques such as sub-vocalization is still useful for denser parts of text.
2. Stop subvocalizing in sparser text by humming (unsustainable) or grouping words by reading between them.
3. Use strategy by utilizing these techniques by sprinting between dense text, take processing breaks, and making lines short.

### Highlights and Notes

- Sub-vocalization, at least in your mind isn't a negative thing
    - You don't subvocalize when you know the part isn't very important or hard to understand
    - But you do subvocalize when it seems difficult and dense
- How to stop subvocalization?
    - Humming in your mind to read faster (not sustainable)
    - grouping words together is better by looking between two words and reading them together
- Strategy is when we use the above techniques?
    - Know which part of the text is dense and which is sparse. Sprint over sparse sections to the next dense section.
    - Use small but frequent breaks to reflect, understand, and predict what's next
    - Use epub files to make each line only 4 to 5 words lone so you only need to group once each line
