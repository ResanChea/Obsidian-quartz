# Dandruff
- Although there is no cure for dandruff, people can reduce and practically eliminate the symptoms and signs associated with dandruff; some obtain good results with over-the-counter dandruff shampoos that contain zinc pyrithione, salicylic acid or selenium sulfide. However, these shampoos are not a cure for dandruff because such shampoos only cause smaller and less visible flakes to be shed. Frequent washing even with regular shampoo may also reduce dandruff symptoms and signs.
