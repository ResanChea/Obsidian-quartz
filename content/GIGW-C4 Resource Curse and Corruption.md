- Resource curse: the failure of state to use its own resources to improve its own country.

# Historical Rise of Governance

- Resource curse comes from problems of governance
- Oil rich countries before 1990s were put through Western Imperialism
    - Africa
    - Oil companies shift blame of exploitation to politicians
- Corruption focused analysis
    - Corruption can't be seen through actions of actors
    - must be seen through global level as well as domestic
- There are flaws in measuring corruptions
- Before 1990s: Western Imperialism of Africa
    - Poverty, hunger, political instability
- 1990s: focus on environmental change and corruption
- Government should be at fault for not solving societal problems from revenues of oil/resource rich countries.

# The Queue

- What is the queue?
- How the queue can describe why mineral-dependent countries tend to be more corrupt than others:
    - Disturb in physical queue (economic shock or terrorist attack):
    - Push in at the front (loss of trust in order)
        - people lose trust in the system
    - They‚Äôre trying to divert those resources for their own good.

# How resource divide a nation?

- Agricolia : the north and the south share similar benefit.
- Petroland : the north and the south compete to earn more benefit resulting is social fragile at all level.
- Polarization and social fragmentation are affected by conflict over mineral money.
- Diversion can occur by religious, ethnicity, political faction, and horizontal division
- Oil dependence and oil-based political conflict can lead to the fragmentation of a nation.

# Petroland as the queue

- **Agricolia** represent the diverse network of production and better subsequent collaboration.
- **Petroland** represents what people are queuing or competing for.
- The ‚Äúmisuse‚Äù and ‚Äúprivate gain‚Äù are the core behavior in corruption.

# VI. Cross-Border Corruption

- Corruption is a global problem
    - Financial institutions even in global level
    
    
    üí° **Corruption Perception Index**: Switzerland is the least corrupt country, but it wasn't accurate
    
    
    
- Elf system-Gabon and nearby countries slush funding French political
parties and intelligent services
- Extractive Industries Transparency Initiatives (EITI)
    - country-to-country approach
- Investigating role of tax and tax havens
- Transparency international-going through significant organizational changes ‚Üí more engaging in tax havens

# Alternative Ways of thinking about Corruption

- Elites abusing public goods to advance narrow interest:
- widen inequality, increase poverty, and undermines the faith in government
- people depend heavily on perceptions of what others do
- Italy: people that pay tax are called a bit thick headed
- tax compliance depends positively on individual‚Äôs perceptions of others compliance level

# Policy

Approaches

- systemic solution that counteracts the government allocation of money is democracy
- deeply analyze the division in society, economic policy, and the distribution of resources:
    - who will benefits, how should policy be changed, or does financial liberalization work
- Transparency: state that lack transparency undergo two process
    - the secret of government's earning, funding source, and what they use it for
    - citizens will be outraged about corruption and protest
- changing transparency relationship will help
    - citizens don't use mobilization

### Analysis

- corruptions come from big and powerful countries
- pattern of corruption: elite and the rich and politically powerful groups of
people
    - makes corruption unavoidable
    - people are selfish and greedy
    - people are competitive
- we want all of what we gain
- honesty and trust should be build from individuals
    - A leader of a country must show transparency or corruption will prosper

# Distributing oil revenues directly: an answer?

- Distributing oil revenues directly, and equally, to all citizens in a producer country, then taxing them directly on their income.
    - systematic solution
- The benefits of this policy are:
    - There is the welfare effect: direct transactions creates long term wealth and income
    - It transforms the nature of politics: economic competition instead of relying on political lobbying
- Objection on this policy:
    - Giving citizens money, then taxing them, is inefficient and costly.
    - Citizens have direct incentives to spend wisely; politicians often have incentives to spend unwisely.
    - In an ideal world, a ‚Äòqueue‚Äô might be a good way of distributing benefits from oil.

# Q&A

- How can Cambodia learn from the concept of resource curse?
    - Be careful about who we do bussiness or associate with
    - Not rely on one source of income such as natural resources
        - Don't put all your eggs in one basket
    - To focus on the long term success and not just short term
        - Some resource rich countries become greedy and not manage their profits properly
- Would these resource rich countries do any better if they didn't have a colonial past?
    - Institutions and systems are left over and used after colonialism
    - without colonial power there would still be in-fighting
        - Ex: South Sudanese groups civil war for natural resources
        - Unwillingness to share resources and riches in domestic setting
