Greetings dear sponsor. My name is Liya and it's nice to meet you.  To tell you a bit about myself. I like wearing blue pants and pink shirts which my mother buys for me. My favorite animal would have to be cows and buffalos because they are very tame and they help my family with hoeing our fields to get ready for planting. Other than cows and buffalos, we also raise other animals such as chickens, ducks, pigs, dogs, cats, and geese. On another note, every day, I like playing games like jumping rope with my friends on the down time. Lastly, I think my parents are those who love me the most.
