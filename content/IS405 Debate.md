- Give one questions to the other team, one day before the debate
    - Something you want them to explain or can't explain to your advantage

# [[Realism\|Realism]]/[[Structural Realism\|Structural Realism]] vs Neo-Liberalism

- Anarchy international system: both theory believes in no higher authority, how does that impact IS
    - [[Neo-Liberalism\|Neo-Liberalism]] : due to interdependence: war is not an option, focus economic policy
    - No world government
    - State is the main actor
    - Self-help and security dilemma
        - Nature of state doesn't change but the structure change
- Pessimistic view of human nature: possibility of human development in cooperation
    - View of IO: cooperative or a tool
        - Realism : when state and IO interest is opposed, they will abandon IO
            - Indonesia & US
            - created by states, given legitimacy and enforcement power by state
    - Neo-Liberalism: the IS has accumulating progress in humanity and gets better
        - Comparison past to now
        - Realism: humanity might have brief spurts of cooperation, but it is fragile and will eventually turn back into conflict as a cycle.
- Regime change: is the cause of war
    - Realism: bipolar & multipolar
    - Collective Action Problem: its hard for a group of actors to get together to solve collective problem [^1]
        - Free ride: as the problem if solved benefits everyone and doesn't matter who contributed, states have incentive to wait for others to solve it for them instead of helping (global warming)
            - If everyone free rides the objective will fail because it does need contributions
    - Interdependence, MAD
    - The cycle of IS changes still results in State as most important actor
- Utopianism vs Realism
- Interdependence
    - Neo-Liberalism: believes in 'leveling effect'
    - Realism: as earlier advanced states invest in technology first, later advancing states still can't catch up ‚áí 'leveling effect' doesn't happen
- What is power? Serey & Resan
    - Soft Power: doesn't matter when violent conflict happens
        - Economic power more important than military?
    - Hard Power: concentrated in state, ability to make someone do something they wouldn't do by themselves

- Realism's weakness
    - Why can some states without military power challenge a powerful state? [^2]
        - Iceland challenging UK for fishing area: it used law method rather than military. It threatened to leave the NATO if UK kept harassing it (it had a NATO base)
            - membership in a multinational institution as a mechanism of power
        - Realism's Weak Counter: National politics, international institutions, and ideological or cultural affinities among nations have little relevance to FPD,
            - Weakness: but if that's true Iceland would have aligned with the Soviet, but due to cultural differences it didn't
- COVID-19
    - Realism: Why do countries have vaccine technology and don't share it with everyone. Commercial benefits, selfishness,
    - COVAX


üí° Research Cold War, if it's success

- Reductionist approach to IS studies


- 

cooperation isn't impossible but not long lasting

concessions are made by smaller

when larger states get what they want it will end
