# Introduction

After cold-war ASEAN played centrality role for regional security

- ARF: failed to handle SCS & Trade War

# ASEAN Way & Centrality

## Centrality Role

- The hosting of meetings
- New ties of political and economic
- Maintain and enhance ASEAN leading role in East Asia regionalism

## What is ASEAN Way?

- Cooperate in all aspects except sensitive issues

Treaty of Amity and Cooperation

- ARF: not effective in making actions, no binding power, prevent conflicts, not solve them
- Consensus based decision making â‡’ hard to take any actions

### Weakness of ASEAN Way

- Less human rights
- Unsolved disputes (non consensus)
- Neighbors conflicts

# China-US Regional Conflict

After Cold War China rise

Major power competition

## China-US Trade War: 2018

Impose 25% tariffs on Imported Chinese goods.

Real Intention:

- Stop china from growing to compete with US in domestic Market

## South China Sea Dispute: 1974

Overlapping territories in ASEAN and China

US Fears: China control of SCS will challenge US's trade routes

China wants bilateral negotiation | ASEAN wants multilateral negotiation

China's and US's involvement destroys unity in ASEAN

# Failure in Handling Regional Disputes

1. Lacking unity in the region
    - Diversity of different kinds, many different interests
2. Hard to reach consensus
    - Thailand-Cambodia conflict: no permission from Thailand for involvements
    - Malaysia-Indonesia conflict: 2 islands
3. Respecting sovereignty and non-interference norm
    - Cannot interfere in human rights violation in the region (Rohingya)

# Conclusion
