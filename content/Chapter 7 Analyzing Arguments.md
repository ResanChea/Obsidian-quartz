To Analyze an Argument is to identifying what argument is being argued relying on what grounds to see if its strong or not.

# I. Diagraming Short Arguments

- Short Arguments: around 1 paragraph long

A because B, C, D.

**Step 1:** read and find premises and conclusion indicators

A because B, C, D.

**Step 2:** Number statements as they appear in the argument

(1)A because (2)B, (3)C, (4)D.

**Step 3:** put the premises above leading to the conclusion

(2) (3) (4)

(1)

**Step 4:** Omit irrelevant statements

**Step 5:** put arrows pointing from the premises to the conclusion

- **Independent Support**: is when a premise will stand on it's own and will give the same amount of support to the conclusion either with or without other premises.
    
    $\begin{aligned}
    (1)&|(2)\\
    \downarrow &\space \downarrow  \\(&3)
    \end{aligned}$
    

- **Linked Support**: when premises rely on each other to keep their strength supporting the conclusion.
    
    $\begin{aligned}
    (1)&+(2)\\
    &\downarrow\\&(3)
    \end{aligned}$
    

**Sub-Conclusion**: a conclusion proved by two linked support premises, but the conclusion itself act as the premise for the final conclusion


üí° 1. Read through the argument carefully, circling any premise or conclusion indicators
you see.
2. Number the statements consecutively as they appear in the argument. Don‚Äôt number
any sentences that are not statements.
3. Arrange the numbers on a page with the premises placed above the conclusion(s) they support. Omit any irrelevant or redundant statements.
4. Using arrows to mean ‚Äúis offered as evidence for,‚Äù create a kind of flowchart
that shows which premises are intended to support which conclusions.
5. Indicate independent premises by drawing arrows directly from the premises to
the conclusions they are claimed to support. Indicate linked premises by placing
a plus sign between each of the premises, and drawing an arrow from the underlined
premises to the conclusions they support.
6. Put the argument‚Äôs main conclusion at the bottom of the diagram.



# II. Summarizing Long Arguments

To provide a short description of the argument

## 1. Paraphrasing

to restate the original passage in a different way with the same intended meaning.

### Accuracy

to maintain the original intended meaning by the author without bias or misleading

### Clear

to replace technical terms and complex language with simple wordings and to the point wordings

### Concise

to remove unimportant details and put wordy answers into short to the point.

### Charitable

an unclear statement should be interpreted in the most plausible way

## 2. Finding Missing Premises and Conclusion

Enthymeme: sometimes generally accepted or general knowledge is omitted from an argument but still supports the conclusion. It is implied

To fill a missing premise or conclusion in an Enthymeme:

### Faithfully interpret the arguer's intentions

to figure out in what way the author intended for readers to fill in

### Be charitable

interpret the unclear statement in the best case possible for the author's intention

## 3. Summarizing Extended Argument


üí° Method to do Article Analysis Assignment



to analyze arguments with multiple linked premises and sub conclusions

1. Number the statements in logical order of premises to conclusion
2. Remove unimportant statements
3. Fill in missing premises or conclusions in square brackets [C]
4. put in parenthesis of the statement that support each statement 1. A (B)


üö´ Mistakes to avoid:
1. Don‚Äôt write in incomplete sentences.
2. Don‚Äôt include more than one statement per line.
3. Don‚Äôt include anything that is not a statement.
4. Don‚Äôt include anything that is not a premise or a conclusion.
