Rather than setting out a paradigm through which everything is understood, [[Post-Structuralism\|Post-Structuralism]]  is a critical attitude, approach, or ethos that calls attention to the **importance of representation**, the **relationship of power and knowledge**, and the **politics of identity** in an understanding of global affairs

- Studies ontology and epistemology of theories


üè¶ Discourse: communications and debates



Assumption: Men are by nature political animal 

‚Üí all actions are political

- The words they speak/write
- Their behavior
- They know what they're doing and have a political purpose

Example: Political actors use discourses like maps to push a political motive

- Mercader: puts Europe as the center of the world
- ????: puts Asia as the center of the world

Case study is important (Page 239)

# Poststructuralism Relations with IR

- Criticizes traditional theories (realism & liberalism) as shaping what could be said about international politics
    - dominant approaches to IR were unaware, uninterested, or hostile to how knowledge of the world was constructed

## Criticize Realism

poststructuralism began by questioning how the state came to be regarded as the **most important actor** in world politics, and how the state came to be understood as a **unitary** in Realism

- still focuses on states, but criticize Realist's use of states' superiority as the foundation of the theory
- poststructuralism is concerned with the state‚Äôs historical
and conceptual production, and its political formation, economic constitution, and social
exclusions

# Inter-disciplinary Context of Post-structuralism

- Positivism started from the Enlightenment Period where church's power switched to state's power making knowledge = power
- PS says [[Positivism\|Positivism]]  itself only accepted scientific reasons
    - addressing human, social, and political issues became questions of order and efficiency

## Post-positivist Criticism of Positivism

In support of Post-structuralist thinking 

- Post-positivists criticizes positivist's understanding of the **subject/object relations** in the theories of knowledge
- Subject & Object construct one another and not of any pre-given entities
