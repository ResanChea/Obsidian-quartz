# First Aid

- Why do we learn first aid
	- To save lives
	- Prevent further life threatening incident
	- For people in society to feel more safe
	- To respond to emergency and make the doctor's job easier
		- From life threatening to manageable
- Outline of what to do in first aid
	1. Protect from further incident
	1. Check for life
		- Check breathing: if fainted
		- Check pulse: if heart is pumping
		- Check brain functions: make patient follow your finger with their eyes
			- If no problem: can move them and carry
		- Check limbs: if no problem, can carry
			- Legs: if can't move -> could be spinal injury
	1. Call ambulance
	1. Calm patients: don't let anyone move them
	1. Clean up after yourself: masks, equipment, towels
## Fainting
- Don't block the airway by
	- Laying on a pillow/lap
	- Lay on their side instead
- Move them to recovery position by
	- Straighten limbs and protect joints
	- One arm in V shape
- Don't put pressure on injured area
## Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)
- Purpose
	- Only for fainting, no pulse, or no breathing
	- To resuscitate the heart
	- To replace the heart's function
- Very time sensitive
	- Don't spend time checking pulse if you know they aren't breathing (drowning)
- CPR pump 30 times (100-120 pumps/min)
	- Then 2 blows through the mouth and repeat
	- Push down 1/3 the depth of the torso
- Body types
	- Adults: use both hands
	- Teenagers: use one hand only
	- Infants: three fingers extended only, or use thumbs
## Shock
- Cause:
	- Loss of blood
	- Lack of oxygen
	- Exhaustion
	- Intense pain
- Symptoms: Shock stops all 3 systems of life
	- Lost/lack of consciousness: don't let the victim fall asleep
	- No Breathing
	- No Heart beats
- Treatment:
	- Remove the cause of the shock
	- Elevate the patient's legs higher than their heart
	- Cover them with a blanket
## Checking for life
- Systems of life
	- Consciousness
	- Breathing
	- Heart beat
1. Ask for a response/consciousness
1. Check breathing: if breathing -> heart is pumping
	- Count breaths for 10 seconds
	- Times by 6 to get breaths/min
		- 12-20/min for adults
		- 20-30/min for 1-8 years old
		- 30-40/min for <1 years old
	- If not breathing start CPR
1. Check pulse: check the wrist or neck for heart beats
	- Count pulse for 10 seconds
	- 60-80 pulse/min for adults
## Choking ស្លាក់
- The epiglottis is what keeps food/water from going down the wind pipe
	- Your mind helps determines which tube to open
- Knock on their upper back to push the block out
- Do the Heimlic maneuver
