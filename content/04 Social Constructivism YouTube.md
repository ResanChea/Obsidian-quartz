Child:: [[Social Constructivism\|Social Constructivism]]

### Highlights and Notes

- In logic of appropriateness: Actors rarely make rational decisions, but follows what is expected of them or established as norms/habits already

# Agent Structure Problem of [[Constructivism\|Constructivism]]

- [[Max Weber\|Max Weber]]: actors are free individuals makes accumulative actions forming into a society
    - Bottom up approach: we look at individual level to understand the upper levels (state & int.)
- [[Emile Durkheim\|Emile Durkheim]]: how members of society is socialied into the social system
    - Actors are structured according to the social rules that exist
    - Up Down approach: social structure determines and shape actors in them
- The debate is heged or solved by third â€˜structurationâ€™ approach: [[Anthony Giddens\|Anthony Giddens]]
    - Neither bottom-up or top-down
    - Actors are shaped by social structures
    - Actors also have some autonomy in shaping the social structures as well
    - Itâ€™s a continuous dynamic $\small\boxed{\textsf{Agent}\leftrightarrows \textsf{Structure}}$
- Different types of constructivism
    - USâ€™s: using material theories of traditional IRTs then using Constructivism assumptions to facilitate in understanding how those ideas affect the traditional understanding
        - Liberalism + Values, norms, & identities
        - Realism + Values, norms, & identities
    - Europe: its more critical constructivism
        - Closer to [[Post-Structuralism\|Post-Structuralism]] or [[Post-Modernism\|Post-Modernism]]: criticizing IR for being to rational on its outlooks, and epistemology of it

# Different schools of IR

- Norms Analysis: focus on how norms evolves and changes over time
    - Led by [[Martha Finnemore\|Martha Finnemore]]
    - Life Cycle of Norms: emergence, cascade, internalization: human rights
- Mainstream (social) Constructivism: focus on the role of social structures in political settings
    - Led by [[Alexander Wendt\|Alexander Wendt]]
    - â€˜Social Factsâ€™: socially constructed/agreed-upon meanings/values to meaningless things (Money, Security, Sovereignty)
        - They can change due to world context: after [[9 11\|9 11]], â€˜freedom fightersâ€™ became â€˜terroristsâ€™
    - [[Anarchy is what States Make of it (1991)\|Anarchy is what States Make of it (1991)]]
        - It seeks to be a middle ground: mixes to one coherent whole
            - material & rationalistic aspects ([[Positivism\|Positivism]]) + culture & identity ([[Post-Positivism\|Post-Positivism]])
        
        ðŸ’¡ Anarchy exist but we can construct it into something with different effects
        
- Critical Constructivism: not part of, but everything is socially constructed
    - Distinction between â€˜selfâ€™ and â€˜othersâ€™
    
    	ðŸ’¡ Ex: Western think of themselves as rational, peaceful, civilized as compared to Islam
    
    
    - [[Nicholas Onuf\|Nicholas Onuf]]: the world is a thing we made.
        - When we naturalize speaking world order as anarchy, it becomes anarchic

- Is social constructivism a theory?
- If material things doesnâ€™t matter and everything is a social construct, what form should IR take?
