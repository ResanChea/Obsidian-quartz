Answer Why Emergency Power? In accordance with the ASEAN Values, we value stability, security, and order more than the westernized idea of liberal freeness which can produce chaos like in the US right now. The emergency authority of the government will be extremely useful in maintaining a strict and thorough management of society in this time of crisis without producing panic.

- Government Transparency: Hidden information, false cases numbers
- Planning and Preparedness: focus on stockpiling Personal Protective Equipment and maintain infrastructures to do mass testing

# Todo
