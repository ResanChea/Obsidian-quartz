# Notes

Look at the practicality of your measures

- Compliance with int law but can't be implemented
- Use evidence to argue your point, past events

One person one vote isn't practical with Somalia situation?

Prove Somalia government have consented for election/other things to be taken place

Study draft resolution

- Prepare amendments
- Use name of countries instead of pronouns (I, you, they)

Request motion, debate & discuss the clause before voting on the motion

Sponsor must be better prepared to defend draft

Point of personal privileges: for bathroom breaks?

Lobby sponsor for friendly amendments: change without voting

If sponsor doesn't agree, it's unfriendly amendment

- open caucus to debate the amendment
- motion to vote

Could offend sponsor if you don't lobby first
