# Feminism: Discussion of Gender in IR

# Gender in IR [^1]

### Third debate in the [[The Four Great Debates in IR\|The Four Great Debates in IR]]

- **The third debate**: scholars began to question the epistemological and ontological foundations of a field (positivist, rationalist, and materialist theories)
    
    Example: 
    
    - [[Post-Positivism\|Post-Positivism]] scholars questions [[Positivism\|Positivism]]'s beliefs
    - **Post-Positivist** rejects rationalist methodologies and causal explanation
- Post-Positivist advocate more interpretive, ideational, and sociological methods for understanding global politics
- **Many feminist** share this Post-Positivist commitment to examine the relationship between **knowledge and power**
    - Feminist point out that most **knowledge has been created by men and is about men**

### Conventional IR vs IR feminist

- Conventional IR relies on generalized [[Rationalism\|Rationalism]] explanation of asocial states' behavior in an anarchic international system
- IR feminist theories focus on social relations (gender relations). Rather than anarchy, they see an international system constituted by socially constructed gender hierarchies
    - In order to reveal gender hierarchies, feminists often begin their examinations of international relations at the micro-level how lives of individual affect and are affected by global politics

### IR Feminist Research

- IR feminist research can be divided into two complementary but distinct generations:
    - First generation: focused on theory formulation
        - bringing to light and critiquing the gendered foundations of IR theories and of the practice of international politics
    - Second generation: approached empirical situation with gendered lenses
        - begun to develop their own research programs
        - use gender as a category of analysis
