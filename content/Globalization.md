# Globalization

## Definition [^1]

- **Weak definitions** of Globalizations as 'Internationalism', 'Liberalization', 'Universalization', and 'Westernization' are weak in
    - not fitting all criteria's of a good definition [[What are the criteria of a meaningful definition \|What are the criteria of a meaningful definition ]]
        - Old wine new bottle
        - Too fixed or narrowly scoped
        - Too biased to one idea than another

- The supposedly 'superior' 5th definition of Globalization is:
	- Globalization is The supra-territorial/trans-planetary connection
		- space can influence all aspect of your lifestyle
		- **trans-planetary**: the connection exist and apply across the whole planet. Geography, global weather... that surpass border barriers

>[!caution] 
>**Policy makers** should look out for these misperceptions when defining what problems needs addressing and not have misperceptions about influences of globalization.
