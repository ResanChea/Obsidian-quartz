# SHEA and Safeguarding
- Able to report Safeguard concerns
- Able to apply basic Safeguarding practices to ensure safe work
- Definitions
	- Sexual Harassment, Exploitation, and Abuse (SHEA)
	- **Safeguarding**: Safeguarding refers to the policies and processes that an organisation puts in place to prevent and respond to harm of a sexualised nature including sexual harassment, abuse, and exploitation carried out by staff or those working on our behalf.


## Why SHEA and Safeguarding is important at ActionAid

1. The organization [[ActionAid\|ActionAid]] could have great goals
	- But the process and staffs could cause the harm its trying to eradicate
		- Sexual Harrasement...
	- ActionAid's Code of Conduct already include many of these values and expectations
2. Harm can come from
	- Deliberate sexual harrasement
	- Accidental: the designed program fails and expose participants to risks
3. Safeguarding is everyone’s responsibility
	- It's everyone's job to keep the workplace safe

## What ActionAid's SHEA and Safeguarding approach actually do
- Aware of your power to not do harm and ensure harm isn't done
- To prevent harm: by preventing behaviors in AA's workspace
	1. Sexual abuse: non-consensual, forced, pressured sexual activities
	1. All sexual relationship with children
	1. Sexual Harrassment
		- Verbal: comments about someone's sex life
		- Physical: unwanted physical contact
		- Non-verbal: Staring, inappropriate text, phone calls
	1. Relationship with adult-at-risk: 
	1. Transactional & buying sex
	1. [[Child Abuse\|Child Abuse]]
	1. Romatic relationship at work: love relationship, unannounced?
		- Prohibited: with community members and higher role with lower role (power relation)
		- Discouraged, but not prohibited: equal & consensual relations but must be declared to manager for assessment

# [[Power\|Power]]

- What is the role of power in safeguarding harm?
	- Power is access to things others need, we can use that power positively or negatively
- Positive Use of Power: Power used to challenge oppression, build solidarity, fight for rights of all
	- Give power to the vulnerable
		- Callout abuse of power
		- Use power to create positive changes

- Different types of power
	- Power over: have control over situation or people with less power
	- Power to: to make positive change through actions that empowers the powerless
	- Power with: is the collective effort and action of being in solidarity to give power/voice to the marginalized
	- Power within: awareness of our own individual capability to make a change, the choice to have an impact on a situation. Wheter you take action or not is your power/choice.

- Power imbalance creates [[Inequality\|inequality]]
	- [[Feminism\|Feminism]] dealt with [[Gender Equality\|gender equality]]

- How to challenge power-imbalance
	>"ensure all colleagues, communities, young people, marginalized groups, and children that we work with are listened to and that their voices lead to change."
	- When doing anything, ask yourself if its accessible to everyone, are there hidden prejudice, how do i get a more holistic and thourough POV

- When power-imbalance and other forms of oppression mix it creates safeguarding harms
	- [[Racism\|Racism]]
	- Sexism

# Reporting Safeguarding Harm

- ==Zero tolerence==: all cases, no matter the severity, must be treated equaly and not be neglected
	- Solve when issue is still small, don't let develop/pile-up

- Types of concerns that should be reported
	- Concern of sexual violence towards community members
	- Concern of harm towards children
	- Concern of abuse at work
	- Other concerns: bullying, harassment, corruption
	- Uncertain about whether to report: should report anyway
	
- When should you report?
	- When you witness or suspect harm
	- When you are the survivor: you can choose to report or not and take time

- Barriers to reporting concerns
	- Fear of being not believed or waved away and fear of facing stigma from community
		- ==Not having evidence to support your argument==
	- Not knowing how to report
	- Thinking they will face consequences for reporting (losing job)
		- Being discriminated because 'rash' actions
	- Thinking they will be blamed themselves

## AA's reporting process

	- Discuss with perpatrator casually: if the issue is resolvable or not serious/dangerous
	- Reporting formally
		- Line Manager

	- HR line will talk to the perpatrator, if they accept fault, then monitor behavior & progress
	- If reported again: launch investigation
	- File concerning all information of the issue will be destroyed after the issue is over (confidentiality)
- Our responsibility to report
	- Do(s)
