1. What are the key analytical tools to analyze foreign policy behaviors?
- Strategic Culture: is political culture transferred from generation to generations through education and social process (isolationism)

# Foreign Policy Images

1. What are the Foreign Policy Images in IR studies? 
    - [[Kenneth Waltz Images of IR\|Kenneth Waltz Images of IR]]: what variables to look at when analyzing FP. [^1]
        - **First Image: Individual**
            - [[Rational Choice Theory\|Rational Choice Theory]] : leaders have input from advisors of all fields + personal experience in cost/benefit + pressure by mass public elector
            - Cognitive School of Thoughts: leaders aren’t always rational as we think they are, and have cognitive fallacies such as
                - group-think: fitting in
                - cognitive dissonance: ignore negative info
                - cognitive consistency: glorify past methods for current situation
        - **Second Image: States**
            - The political system: democratic, authoritarian/autocracy, bureaucracy, technocracy, authoritarian, transitional
            - Ruling elites: dictators, populism
            - Political Ideology: [[Liberalism\|Liberalism]] or [[Conservatism\|Conservatism]]
            - Religion: Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, Religious Fundamentalism
            - Interest Group, Public opinion, Strategic Culture
        - **Third Image: External or Structural Factor**
            - Realism: FP tools are used to act, react, and interact in the int’ environment depending on **polarity of system**.
            - Liberalism: multiplex world order

# Levels of Foreign Policy

1. What are the levels of Foreign Policy when analyzing it? [^1]
    - Between Individual, State, and International level, which one determine what FP is chosen.
    - Individual Level
        - Advisors + leaders + experience + public pressure
        - Individuals aren’t perfect, they have cognitive fallacies
        - [[David Singer\|David Singer]]: individual level is already accounted for by electoral process in state level
    - State Level: [[David Singer\|David Singer]] supports it
        - Internal and external factors ⇒ impact electoral framework & institutions ⇒ impact which national goal is picked (goal & purpose of national policy)
        - It explores
            - Material dynamics: determine the power level of states and who to pursue through FP
            - Nature of State: political system and institutions determines their behavior (Ex: [[Democratic Peace Theory\|Democratic Peace Theory]])
    - International Level: [[Kenneth Waltz\|Kenneth Waltz]] Int’ system is the strongest determinant of FP
        - Nature and rules of int’ system
        - Distribution of power among state and non-state actors: economic capability, military strength, resource endowment, political competence, and competence
        - Polarity of int’ system: uni-polar, bi-polar, multi-polar

# Foreign Policy Arena

1. What is Foreign Policy Arena? [^2]
    - the terrain on which FP is conducted: Domestic, Government, International Context
    - The terrain have forces which shape FP making & implementation such as Actors, Interest, Issues
2. What is the FP arena for?
    - The three contexts of FP arena are spaces for actors, issues, and interests to populate it to formulate FP.
3. Elaborate on the terrains of FP Arena. [^2]
    - International Context: is most important because ‘Foreign’ Policy is it’s entire point
        - Uncertainty the environment: shift in balance of power, hegemonic order, hierarchical international system
        - Assess international context change and it’s impact on FP making
            - Location of activity: which geographical location is the main focus of the international community on political and economical issues
                
                ![IS401 Revi/Untitled.png](/img/user/assets/IS401%20Revi/Untitled.png)
                
            - Focus of Activity: emergence of new issues in environmental issues, Socio-Economic Issues arising from globalization, prolonged security challenges, geo-strategic and geo-economic competition
            - Instrument of Activity: the means to get to the end: soft, hard, and smart power
                - Realism: ideological warfare, using economic or military pressure.
                - Liberalism: Now soft power is more effective due to interdependence
    - Governmental Context
        - Government is the representative of the national state, claim for sovereignty and security.
            - All governments have the same principle even though each had a different version of the FP problem
        - Governmental structure for FP making are open to challenge and change
            - Change: Organizational restructuring more open to reflect change in int’ context
            - Challenge: Western Society’s: scope & scale of government increased in the transformed world
                - Government might not have diplomatic skill or capacity to deal with it’s large scope effectively
    - Domestic Context
        - Pattern of communication and information sources makes the support and pressure of non-state actors influence domestic politics
        - Domestic view is only attentive to FP during major national crises
            - Mass public is normally uninformed or uninterested

# Foreign Policy Instruments

1. What are the types of diplomacy?
    - **Bilateral Diplomacy**
    - **Multilateral Diplomacy**
    - **Summit Diplomacy**: conference diplomacy (less institutionalized) to remove tension, build confidence, trust, and share ideas
    - **Ad Hoc Diplomacy**: special envoys on missions for diplomatic relations
    - **Parliamentary Diplomacy**
        - Institutional: happens in legislative process, parliamentary monitoring, and direct political role of parliament
        - Diplomatic:
            1. Bilateral: parliament of one country work with another country’s parliament
            2. Multilateral: parliamentary delegations in parliamentary meetings of 10s
            3. Different forms of associations of parliaments around the world (Inter-Parliamentary Union)
    - **Quiet Diplomacy**: actors keep quiet about problem until solution is found to avoid scrutiny from third party, domestic, or int’ involvement.
        - Open/Secret Diplomacy: whether diplomatic relations carried out is with the consent of the public (threats of war)
    - **Coercive Diplomacy**: military strategy to make states or non-state actors to behave a certain way.

# Foreign Policy Making (FPM) [^3]

1. What is FPM?
    - **Foreign Policy Making** (FPM) is the process by which the government analyse existing problems, evaluate policy alternatives, and take appropriate actions to solve the important issues and maximize national interest.
2. Images of FPM
    1. **Rational Actor Image**: it retains an assumption of rationality that is possessed by policy makers. State is unitary actor
        - [[Realism\|Realism]]: selfish → competitive nature FP
        - [[Structural Realism\|Structural Realism]]: anarchy → self-help FP
        - [[Rational Choice Theory\|Rational Choice Theory]]: policy makers operate under constrains of time, knowledge, & place
    2. **‘Political’ Foreign Policy Making Image**: Political and bureaucratic elites have a great influence over the FPM through political activities. State is not a unitary actor
        - policy is outcome of political bargaining & interaction between int. and domestic level
        - Two-Level Game Theory: to balance/negotiate benefits between domestic and international level groups
            - Attempt to favor one constrains the other
        - Closest to Bureaucratic politics model: bureaucratic position → bureaucratic interests → policy preference
        1. **‘Psychological’ Images**: Personal characteristic of policy leaders will have a determining impact on the nature of policy
            - Common behaviors of FP makers
                - FP makers can only imagine their ideal ‘subjective’ world and hope it translate to the favorable ‘objective’ world of reality.
                - Cognitive biases, perceptual distortion due to uncertainty and complexity
3. What is FPM in context of transformed world?
    - Rational Actor Image: [[Kenneth Waltz\|Kenneth Waltz]] dismisses changes, Int’ system is still anarchic, objective is still survival and security.
    - Political FPM
        - Constructivism: Complex int’ events → adaptation in FPM: new institutions, processes, adaptation method
        - Increased significance of domestic politics on FPM
        - More channels of contact among society: intergovernmental, ministerial, transnational, and lobby state channels.
    - Psychological Image: the use of past solutions won’t solve current day new problems
        - States still focus on security when economic is what is important now
4. What is the difference between FPM during a routine and crisis policy making?
    
    
    | Routine FPM | Crisis FPM |
    | --- | --- |
    | Policy initiation based on incremental adjustment | Policy making as response to surprise event |
    | Low/moderate stress level | High stakes and stress level |
    | Wide number of policy makers | Small number of policy makers |
    | Broad range of options | Narrow range of options |
    | Long lead time in policy formation | Limited time to respond |
    | No likelihood of force | Likelihood of force |
5. How does FPM differ in different types of political systems?
    - Between Democratic, Authoritarian, and Transitional regimes
    - Sources of influence on Policy: leader, public, bureaucrats
    - Form/existance of political competition/conflict
    - Stability of government
    - survival of practices of old regime

# Case Studies

- What are the FP for contemporary states of the world?
- US’s Trump
    - Political Ideology of Leader: Conservative → isolationism → retrenchment from int. arena
    - Ruling Elite: Populism president, public pressure/opinion
- [[COVID-19\|COVID-19]]: time pressured, crisis policy making
- [[Somalia Civil War\|Somalia Civil War]]
- [[Cambodia\|Cambodia]]: UNTAC
