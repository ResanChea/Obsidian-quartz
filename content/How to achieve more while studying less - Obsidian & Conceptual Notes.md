### Summary of main points

1. Instead of taking notes you throw away after exams, take conceptual notes which accumilates over time. Link them together and you'll come across them and use them all the time.
2. Don't note down anything you can easily search up on the internet. Do note down critical thinking answers, analytical approaches, new and original connections.
3. You're not making notes to hoard data, you make it however ugly, unorganized, or accronyms you want that's intelligable and future proof.

### Highlights and Notes

    - Concepts can be connected together to create original concepts that you can develop later down your life, no matter if it's from years ago
- What you should note down in lectures?
    - You don't have to remember things you can search up easily on the internet

- Your notes doesn't have to make sense to anyone but yourself
    - Use shortcuts, analygies
