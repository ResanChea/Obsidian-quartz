# Problems with Solutions

1. Smart Sanctions: aren't as serious
    - Freezing assets, banning travel in country isn't very effective
    - Only act as political show
2. Rohingya situation: cannot just end instability, but also to help the people in need or is discriminated against
    - What are the immediate solutions UN can propose to deal with it?
    - Introduce package of solutions with different purposes
        - Political
        - Humanitarian
3. Condemning statements are not effective
    - Only way to convince military leaders is the show the outweighing benefits of returning democratic system over military
4. ASEAN meeting only to save face
    - To say ASEAN is trying to do something about it
    - But doesn't come to any effective solutions
