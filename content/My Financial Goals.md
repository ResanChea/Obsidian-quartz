# My Financial Goals
- I want to be able to give my child/children a life without the burden of caring for me when I get old and sick.
	- I can also achieve this somewhat through [[My Personal Health\|My Personal Health]]
 - In the next 5 years I want to maintain making at least $1000 USD, not matter in Cambodia or Thailand.
