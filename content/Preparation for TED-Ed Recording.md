- Display Settings
    - Use MOV format instead of MP4
    - Select FHD (ALL-I): ALL-I means it's made for editing later
    - White Balance: normal day time 5500K, 3200K for night time
        - We are in doors so idk
    - Aperture: how much of shot is in focus (2.8 for 1 subject, 22 is for groups) 60
    - ISO: the lower the better. Higher makes visuals more grainy 600-800
- FPS: if you do 100+ fps, it doesn't record internal audio from the camera itself
    - Shutter speed needs to be double framerate (60/120, 50/100)
- Audio
    - Enable Movie Servo AF if you're using external mic
    - Does external mic connect to the camera, how to sync
    - Do we end recording for each student or recut a big video file, audio?
- Equipment guy's name is Pheap, go to B Bill's room to ask for him to get equipment
    - Num: 077 334 372
- Editing
    - Amplify audio if speaking isn't loud enough 12dB and -6dB.
    - Turn mono audio (only in right channel) to simulate stereo post-production
- Self-note
    - Get HDMI cable extension from your wire bag
    - Get slides from students, preferably PDF
