# 1. Introduction

Bombardier V.S. Boeing: dispute between Canada and U.S. aircraft producers

Canada selling to US for 1/4 production price

⇒ 300% tariff to Bombardier

The State-centered Approach: national policymakers intervene in the economy in pursuit of
objectives that are determined from domestic interest groups’ narrow self-interested concerns.

- One state's use of it's tariffs to benefit it's domestic industries instead
- the conflict is between two export oriented firms battling over global market share

Difference from Society-centered Approach: 

# 2. States and Industrial Policy

Society-centered Approach ≠ States-centered Approach

Impact of **Protectionism on social welfare**

- Society-Centered: Reduce social welfare
- States-Centered: Raise Social welfare

Government's relations with **Interest Groups**

- Society-Centered: national policy reflects the balance of power among competing interest groups
- States-Centered: government is unconstrained by interest groups' demands

## 2.1. The Infant-Industry Case for Protection

Government Intervention: The long-run welfare gain will be better than the short-run. 

Industries are inefficient in the beginning but after maturity, the industry can export and the tariff can be removed. 

Why?

$\small\bullet$ **Economic of Scale**: the more of the same product you produce creates $\small\begin{cases}\textsf{lower price} \\ \textsf{better quality} \end{cases}$

You cannot create lots of the product if it's inferiors than your competition

- When infant industry reach economic of scale ⇒ welfare gain
- Economies of Experience: skilled labor in a new industry can only be acquired by producing the products in the industry. Long run gain is more
    - Moving Down the Learning Curve: Over time skills and experience will lower costs

Protectionism on infant industry is needed in the beginning but can be removed after it's competitive.

## 3. States Strength: The Political Foundation of Industrial Policy

## 3.1. Industrial Policy

The policy which government adopt to develop domestic infant industries

- Tax Policy
- Subsidies
- Protectionism
- Government Procurement: have government use domestic products over imported

to enhance international competition from a non-competitive industry

## 3.2. States Strength

The Degree of market independence of a country from another's influence

  **Strong**

1. Centralized Authority
2. High level of Coordination
3. Limited influences from interest groups

  **Weak**

1. Decentralized Authority
2. Low level of cooperation
3. High level of influence from interest groups


✊ It's faster for stronger states to make un-rivaled decisions either whether/when to protect or liberalize certain industries



Japan used Industrial policy "The Administrative Guidance"

- Shift resources from one industry to another
- Give incentive & subsidized

United States

- Have divided government
    
    (Republican vs Democrats)
    
- Interest groups have bigger influence

# 4. Industrial Policy in High Technology Industries

High technology is important for developed countries

## 4.1. Strategic-Trade Policy

1. Economic Theories justified the use of industrial policy in high-tech industries
    
    The First Mover Advantage: States which join the market industry first will have the advantage and win
    
    - Later states will have to use industrial policy to develop it's infant industry or lose
    - First Mover has Economic of Scale and Economic of Experience

Oligopolistic Market: only have one monopoly without a close rival or competition

The market can only support one monopoly company at a time

- If one company rise, another must fall (Zero-Sum)

2. 

## 4.2. Impact of Industrial Policy in High-Tech Industries

1. Government intervention: could help to establish high-tech industries in international market by subsidies & incentives
2. Government Policies: 

# 5. Strategic Rivalry in Semiconductors and Commercial Aircraft

## 5.1. Strategic Rivalry in Semiconductors

US had dominated this industry

- Funded for 80% of all R&D in US
- Provided a critical market

Japanese joined later, therefore protected

- Protectionism, stopped US imports
- require Japanese government to use domestic products, instead of imported

## 5.2. Strategic Rivalry in Commercial Aircraft

US's Boeing and Douglas was dominant

Europeans' Airbus protected ⇒ grew
