# The Development of Diplomatic Negotiation

- Everything has been invented, they're only shaped to fit the current context throughout history
- **3000 BCE**: Ancient Near East had friendly relations with diplomatic negotiations, communications, gift giving ceremonies, and marriages arrangements.
- **1960s BCE**: peace negotiations between Mari and Hammurabi over the possession of Hit
    1. Draft Text of peace Treaty: written by a king
        - to offers Trade and concerns over one another's wants and needs
            - Familiar procedures and ploys
            Arguments about morality, legitimacy, love, family piety, vanity,
            interest, the law and treaty obligations
            - Intelligence on military and diplomatic matters
            - Soothsayers and prophets playing important role in decisio:
            making process
            - Exchange of princesses, gifts, physicians and sacred idols
            - Issues of finance, trade, stability and survival of the regime,
            prestige, interest, the defense of the realm and imperial expansion
            - communications, gift giving ceremonies, and marriages arrangements.
    2. Exchange Drafts of Treaty: tablet messages sending
    3. Third-Party
- **Late 10th Century BCE**: convention and tactics of diplomatic negotiation has been shaped and honed into a standard
- **3000 Years Later**: The procedures and substance of negotiation has evolved, but there are still family resemblances left in relations


ðŸ’¡ Why study historical cases of Negotiation?

- to understand the invariant structural features of negotiation as a wide view
- to understand how negotiation evolved and how it came to be how it is today. Similar to study of biology.
- concepts of diplomacy and international relations isn't always reinvented, its built upon from historical development of these processes
- historical development can be drawn on for more context than just looking at present time or recent past


# The Problems of Establishing Outcomes

- Outcomes of negotation has hard to predict
    - because mistrust happens in mutual relations
    - because negotiators (Envoy) has been killed many times
- Killing envoy is a show of power
    
    
    ðŸ’¡ Ex: Shah of Chwarezm (Persian) killing representation of Mongolian ruler Genghis Khan
    
    
    
- In order to gain trust, state/monarchy must exchange hostages
- Arranges marriage of children to form alliances (Ex: Emporer of Byzantiyum and Daughter of Khagan)
    - Violence can still happen

## Establishment of Diplomatic Network and Advance of Weapons Technology

- Diplomatic Networks maintain friendly relations
    - 17th century: bilateral negotiation of two parties in a pre-arranged area (not multilateral yet)
    - Problem: can be a contest of power instead of negotiating
        - To avoid this every representative is treated the same way and on the same level seating
    - 19th century: multilateral negotiation to overlook international power structure
    - 20th century: Court of Arbitration (Hague Peace conference), League of Nations, UN
- Weapons Technology causes deterence from another state attacking

# Changes Over the Centuries

- Internationla negotiation has only changed in its bargaining process from the past till now
1. Improved Technology: 
    - makes greater weapons that causes deterence
    - technology is a tool to shape organizations with easier access to information
2. Regime: rules and negotatiions to control parties that don't comply (sanctions)
    - to establish durable and ongoing states relations
    - to buid greater trust while forgeting about past grievences
3. Trust: secrecy between states lessened trust in the past
    - Modern thinking of Openness is effective in speeding up negotiating process
    - Problem: too transparency could be bad
4. Power: power is better distributed in today's world
    - Distribution of power is better because the creation and usage of IGOs

Diplomacy functions

- The content of foreign affairs as a
whole.
- The conduct of foreign policy.
- The management of international
relations by negotiation
- The use of diplomats in a diplomatic
service
- The adjective â€˜diplomaticâ€™, often
refers to the manner in which
relations are conducted

# Confict of Interest and Power Relationship

- States can have contact in 3 different ways
    - If their interest completely overlap: they must sit down and discuss how business should be conducted on mutual interest with common strategy.
        - no conflict of interest
        - some countries might become diametrically opposed:
- If states have opposing interest...

## Position of a State

- Position of a state is determined by internace differences of interest and opinion and external dependences
    - Destabalize the country
- Ways to influence the Balance of Power
    - Obtain the most information about one's own position, other's position and potentially involved parties
    - Coalition-Forming: are easier to form in multilateral situation for less powerful states to have a voice against a more powerful state than bilateral negotiation
    - Use of Force: when negotiation isn't an option anymore. And its getting much more difficult to use force with the world's interdependence
        - Mosquito Power: extremist, terrorists, and non-state try to weaken big powers such as states

# Inter-state Negotiation

- When common interest > Differences
    - Open negotiation: to find solution to mutual probems
    - Negotiation can only be reached when btoh parties recognize each other's interests
- When common interests < Differences
    - Competitive negotiation
