**Chapter 1: The Challenges of Global Governance**

1. What is global governance? Why is global governance necessary?
    - Global governance is sets of rules, ideas, and norms that state and non-state actors come together to set to address problems such as poverty, climate change, economic issues, or epidemic that affect them all.
    - Collection of joint-mechanisms/arrangements/frameworks to manage common global affairs/to resolve global issue
    
    Global Governance is necessary due to rapid globalization that creates new international issues, which cannot be dealt with by an individual sovereign state.
    
2. The author states that “global governance is not global government.” Explain this

statement.

**Governance Without Government VS Governance With Governance**

- Governance can exist in many levels such as the family, district, or city level for example. While A government can only exist in a sovereign state.
- Governance happens without a body at the global level with sovereign states as its units. However, governance doesn’t have the enforcing power to restrict its rulings. Whereas, a government has a policing/military force that will enforce its laws and regulations.
- Governance has a more democratic method of operating where all actors are equal in power and there is no one leader. On the other hand, a government has a ‘top-down’ hierarchical style of governing where the government has authority over its people and the country.
- Governance is less effective in enforcing its rulings than governments, because of its less binding open-ended rulings in contrast to the stricter governmental one.

3. Explain ‘the pieces of global governance’ and identify all the pieces of global governance.

- International Laws/rules/norms (Conventions/treaties, MOU, ...)
- International Organizations
- NGOs, Cause Groups
- MNCs

4. What are the functions of IGOs? Why do states join IGOs?

IGOs are created for various different functions

- To establish procedures for their members to obey their rules (Punish by sanctions, economic pressures)
- Facilitate states in the international setting by persuading states to coordinate the efforts of different group to tackle global issues. (OPEC to control oil price, control supply/price)
- To create mechanisms in dealing with economic issues, environmental issues, human rights, refugees. (UN has national assembly meetings, which given the opportunity for members to discuss about those certain issues)
- As a platform to bind states together for mutual benefits. (ASEAN for free-trade agreements)

States join IGOs because multiple states acting together is more influential than a lone state. Regional and Global issues cannot be tackled alone.
