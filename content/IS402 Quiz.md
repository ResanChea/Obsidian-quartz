# Draft 1

- Issue #1
- Question #1:
    - As breakthroughs in quantum computing have been happening in recent years, Artificial Intelligence seems like it will only grow more advanced. Not only will AI affect the internet, software, and consumerism in general, it has and will continue to affect the competition between world powers to attain AI supremacy. The world leader in AI, the United States, has been threatened by China's rapidly advancing digital capabilities as the country has strict and exclusive access to data from a fifth of the world's population.
    - Obtainer of AI: Countries holding advanced AI will have an unwritten obligation to utilize it ethically and not let it fall into the wrong hands. However, most nations will breach this rule as to not disadvantage themselves against others who would not hold the same rule.
- Question #2:
    - AI Supremacy: The first nation to develop true Artificial Intelligence will dramatically alter its position in the balance of power, no matter their initial size. AI, as partially utilized in mega-corporations such as Amazon, will allow states to accurately pinpoint its citizen's behavior and interests, and ultimately micromanage its people on an individual level, further fortifying the state's interest, either ethically or morally intrusive. Moreover, a country could deploy AI in many fields to maximize the economy's potential. AI could automate all low skilled work or even advanced repetitive jobs which will boost production capacity dramatically.
    - Breakdown of Democracy: Relevance-from-behavior AI has been optimized to eerily accuracy. Similarly, China is implementing and exploiting this on a much grander scale which collects data without restrictions from democratic norms of privacy. With the upcoming Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to cover nearly 70 countries, China will have access to much more of the world's population's data. Not only will the project develop infrastructure for connectivity, but it will also erect 5G networks, surveillance, and fiber optic for data mining. This furthers the world's negligence of personal privacy, free flow of information, and democratic obligations. Unless the competitor United States also infringes on these citizens' boundaries, the U.S. won't be able to compete with China with AI.
