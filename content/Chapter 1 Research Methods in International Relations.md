- Knowledge is accumulated through experiences and observation
- Focus on process, causes/impacts, roles, events, developments, behavior of actors, practice of international politics.
- Objectiive reality "out there" independent of researchers' perception.

Interpretivism

- Reject application of natural science methods in understanding the international politics
- Focus on idea, beliefs, identity, norms, culture, value, symbolism, perception, social meanings, embedded in international politics.
