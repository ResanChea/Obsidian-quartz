# Follow Up [^1]
- What is follow up?
	- It is the process of monitoring the compliance or fulfilment of parties to the agreed upon promises
	- Response to non-compliance
		- Carrot: talk diplomatically to provide incentive to comply
		- Stick: to punish non-compliance (militarily, economically)
		
- Problem with Follow-Up
    - Some gives decision to International Courts, but that relies on states’ consent,
        - which is always with held when its a sensitive matter
    - No general principle that international rules is more important than domestic rules
    - When consent is given, enforcement mechanisms are inadequate

# Early methods
- Oath Swearing: inviting their gods to bear witness to them in an oath-swearing ceremony
	- Rulers have ceremonies to make promises
	- Rely on belief and faith to monitor
- Tangible Guarantee: sign a contract so there is material punishment for non-compliance
	- Trading land with each other as compensation, didn't catch due to nationalism
- Man of Stature: or preserver committee who overlook the promise
	- Elected carefully with well known neutrality and honesty
	- Problem: can't guarantee 100% of unbiasness
- Treaty of Guarantee: third party guarantor
	- Who have power and ability to punish the breaching party
	- Problem: the third party power doesn't have incentive to help
# Modern Monitoring Mechanisms

## Monitoring by experts

- Agreements can be very technical => require experts
- experts, including scientists, engineers, and lawyers, and sometimes by national intelligence agencies
    - Mostly for Arms control agreements and UN Security Council-imposed disarmament regimes
>[!example]
>- IAEA: monitoring the use of [[Nuclear Weapons\|Nuclear Weapons]] for peaceful use only
>	- Proliferations
- Pro:
	- Technical expertise to know what is best ([[Nuclear Weapons\|Nuclear Weapons]], [[Chemical Weapons\|Chemical Weapons]])
	- No political pressure: professional ethics, more objective, can have no impact on bilateral relations
- Cons:
	- High cost to maintain: charges member states
	- No immunities: no diplomatic protection, can't analyze a country that maticulously without permission
		- seeing only what they want you to see
	- Inability to acquire informations for proper analysis

## Monitoring by embassies

- Diplomats in another country could act as connecting channel of monitoring between the two nations.
- British embassies and ‘Deportations with Assurances’ agreements
- Pro
	- Cheap to maintain
	- Have access to more information in the monitored country, able to gain deeper understanding
	- Have diplomatic immunity
- Cons
	- Impact ability to do their main work of maintaining bilateral relations
		- Can strain bilateral relations: doing more than is required 
	- Not technical agreements
	- Not able to have technical skills like experts

## Monitoring by Review meetings

- Follow up conference, joint comission
	- Parties must compile a report occationally to present in a meeting with each other
	- Reports on progress: (the last 6 months)
- Pro
	- Trust and faith based solutions: more transparent intentions and friendly
	- Naming and shaming pressures of presenting their breaches
		- Must compile reports on time and accurately
	- Promote continuity and momentum: treaty will still be relevant about after its signing
- Cons
	- Cost of setting up meeting
	- Gaps between meetings can't be too long
>[!question]
>- Is there a way of making sure the compiled report from each country could be reliable?
>- Would this work in a relations that is strained?
