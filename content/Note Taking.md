# Note Taking
- In [[Obsidian\|Obsidian]] you should make notes that are titled as sentences like 
	`Diplomacy is the precursor to corcive strategies.md`
	- So you can link to them in a paragraph and make it fit in easily

## Good Practice Rules

- Write in active voice instead of passive to put most important info in the front of sentence
	>[!example]
	>- Passive: Public policy is used by politicians and leaders.
	>- Active: Politicians and leaders uses public policy.

- Types of note taking
	- (child:: [[Conceptual Note Taking\|Conceptual Note Taking]])
	- (child:: [[Sequential Note Taking\|Sequential Note Taking]])

## Daily Notes
- Why should i use **daily notes**?
	1. If i want to test something out like a feature in notion or a dataview/coding feature. I can just drop it in the today's note and have it be there later when i need it referenced again
		- Right now I want to make a note of review chapters of IS407, in waiting for my mid term exam, but don't know where to put it
	2. Use daily notes as fleeting notes!
		- use the fleeting notes app here to put down thoughts wherever when you don't wanna navigate or spend time opening obsidian


# Referencing

- If you’re studying one topic but using multiple sources or articles, don’t make a separate page for each of them, just compile them together, being neat does not help with convenience
- Don’t need to reference if the info is
    - non-controversial
    - not an original argument
    - is niche or specific statistics
- To indicate you reference the paper on page 1, paragraph 4, write `[^1] (p1.4)`

# Atomic and spliting big notes

- When writing notes make sure to accomadate and plan for future spliting
	- Use 1 # for Title and References
	- Use 2 ## for The content
	- Heading 2 should be named in a way that can be split into smaller files with them as their name like Consulate.History
