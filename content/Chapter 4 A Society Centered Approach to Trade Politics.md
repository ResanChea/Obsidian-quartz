what determines the specific trade objectives that governments pursue when bargaining within the WTO, when negotiating regional trade arrangements, or when making unilateral trade policy decisions?

A Society Centered Approach: government's trade policy objectives are shaped by politicians' response to interest groups' demands.

- Trump renegotiate NAFA and others
- Brexit

# 1. Trade Policy Preferences

Factor Model || Sector Model: 

- Raise or lower tariff ⇒ redistribute income
- Income consequence ⇒ dividing society

## 1.1. Factor Model

It's the competition between Capitalists and Workers

Factors of production is moved by the competition

There are two policies that determine the winner and losers:

Winners$\textsf{Liberalized Trade Policy}\small\begin{Bmatrix} 
\textsf{Developed Countries: Capitalists} \\ 
\textsf{Developing Countries: Workers} 
\end{Bmatrix}$ 

Losers$\textsf{Protectionist Trade Policy}\small\begin{Bmatrix}\textsf{Developed Countries: Workers} \\ \textsf{Developing Countries: Capitalists} \end{Bmatrix}$ 

## 1.2. Sector Model

Competition between export-oriented and import-competing sectors or industries

Assumption: the immobility across sectors of the economy

Winners laborer and capitalist employed in export-oriented industries

Losers laborer and capitalists employed in import-competing sectors

# 2. Organizing Interests

Collective Action Problem: situation where individuals would be better off cooperating but fails to do so because of incentive to free ride

Collective Action: help understand 3 characteristics of trade politics

- Why producers rather than consumers dominate trade politics
- Trade politics will exhibit a bias towards protectionism
- Why government rarely liberalize trade unilaterally, but will do so in negotiated agreements

# 3. Political Institutions and the Supply of Trade Policy

$\small \textsf{Electoral System}\begin{cases}\textsf{Majoritarian}\\ \textsf{Proportional Representation}\end{cases}$

## Majoritarian

Uses First-Past-the Post: electoral system in which candidate or party is elected by achievement of a majority vote.

## Proportional Representation

Electoral system in which parties gain seats in proportion to the fraction of vote casted for them

## 3.1. The Electoral System

- shapes how interest groups organize in politics to pursue their trade policy objectives
- Affect the level of protectionism adopted in the country

## 3.2. Veto Players

- A political actor who must agree to have a policy be implemented.
    - In the divided government, two-veto player systems
    - Unified government: one-veto play system
    - Coalition governments: Multi-veto player systems
    - Parliamentary government: single party majority government

The more Veto players the harder to change from the status quo

# 3 Weaknesses

- SCA undermine independence of politicians
- SCA overlook motivation from non-governmental organizations

# Discussion

Why in developing countries labor prefer liberal trade policies while owners of capital prefer protectionist trade policies?

- Workers want free trade as it brings in competitions, higher labors, cheaper products
- Capitalists want closed economy because they could be monopoly, deciding the price and wage

What is trade politics? Trade Policy?

- Protectionism: focused on my capitalists
- Liberalization: focused on my labor

Factor Model

- Determined by competition between the labor and capital (Comparative advantage)
    
    Abundance factor is the winner, scarce factor is the loser
