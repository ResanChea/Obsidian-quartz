Losing my phone in my old high school
My friend sna was racing after Tom nook to help me find
It was during a class. No teacher was coming
I cleaned my phone twice. A girl I liked kept putting her hand on it and made it greasy.
The second time I went, I left it near the washing place outside.
When I'm back the owner of the place was a fatter person. He was working on something and wouldn't help us. He was srtting up a peice of wood with connected slats and would hold up a hangover if plastic covering like a roof. We celebrated a bit about helping him and getting our stuff back. He said oh no, not this easily. I pester him about it being a tiny deal and he should just give it back. He yelled, threw every phone from the table with a table swipe and slammed the door shut on us. Still the. I couldn't find my phone that's on the floor. I picked through my pockets but found a calculator and a phone case that's bent vertically. I borrowed a kid who recovered his phone and called my number. I was having problems cuz for some reason it kept auto typing 088577653462 or addiing an extra letter in there or sth. Finally my friend yelled out and starting racing saying Tom nook was there in the school. Apparently I imagined him as the owner of Bethesda. I got a cut scene explainf how Tom nook was a loner and he came to Cambodia since 2004 to have a quiet life in a gated community with only foreigners not cambodians. Then I woke up.



# Ideas for projects
- We scraping using python on a subreddit
    - what topic are discussed most, tags/type of posts, make into a graph, and post it. Get likes and exp
- create an rss feed for healthy consumption of 5 YouTube videos per day
    - if random is possible from subscription list every day
    - if possible web scrape my watch history and figure out which channel I never miss a video from. And set the channel as prioritized
    - if too many prioritized video one that day, it can be backed up to the next day if not many prioritized videos

Essay idea
- What is the point of life/existence?
- If we look at one extreme, existentialism might set in. Your exist for no reason you born and die and the universe will die one day and nothing matters. 
    - if we look further into this argument what do they actually argue?
- what's at the other extreme? Deterministic world? Atomic level analysis and quantification of all variables in the universe would make the future deterministic. Meaning free choice doesn't exist, it's an illusion.
- if life has no purpose or destiny what's actually important in life? My personal values is if we enjoy life or not? How much do we need to enjoy life? Stoicism. Think of what actually matters in life. Not what matters to your held values, but to your life.
- is proving people wrong, living up to expectations, keeping up with social standards, being caught up with world politics that will never affect you other than through price changes. Does want of that matter in life?
- should emotions of others make you feel anxious, feeling like stepping around eggshells
- is living a life of sedentary where a person lives reading, gaming, eating, consume content alone any worse than a socially active person if they both enjoy what they are doing? Other than reasons of health of course
- the role of religion in offering guidance of purpose, destiny, direction. Maybe it's not so bad after all. Maybe without faith the world would be a depressing hell scape of dooner-pessimists thoughts and no innovative-optimist
