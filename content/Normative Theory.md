# Normative Theory

**Normative theories** define “good” decisions as ones that are most likely to provide the decision maker with desired outcomes, regardless of international norms

- Actors that try to do more than they can fail, while ones who try to maximize their power will win

  >[!example] 
  >World is going through major international order shift after [[9 11\|9 11]] . 
  >[[US\|US]] no longer the leader of the world

- China economic rise
- India and other countries band together to go against world power (US)?
- Uni polar world → Multi polar world
    - Chaotic *transition period*: US tries to keep its leadership position

## Some International Norms can be broken by strong states

- What types of international norms have been violated by [[Strong State\|Strong State]] ?
    - Int’ law is only binding and important and perfect on paper, not in practice
        - Strong states are violators of int norms/laws
        - may get condemnation speeches from other states but don’t hurt them physically

1. The use of force/posession/use of **nuclear weapons**
    - Why some can possess but some can’t? powerful can.
        - Principle of Sovereingty or non-interferance
            - R2P might be a excuse to why they have nuclear weapons
            - They already posess it so why not use it and abuse it: no external power can stop another state’s government
2. UNCLOS: [[China\|China]] claim 90% of [[South China Sea Dispute\|South China Sea Dispute]], claim of freedom of navigation
    - Those who created or proposed the norm themselves, are sometimes violators of those norms
    - Mostly violated norms to exploit against weaker states rather than ones that could negaltively affect their interests
3. [[WTO\|WTO]] rules: violated by almost everyone

## What should be done when international norm is violated?

- other sates may not enter any agreement in the future with violator
- require changes or make up for violating the law for new agreement
- **Problem**: if powerful countries like US and China are main violators of norms, smaller countries would lose much more by not entering agreements with them because they violated.
    - No one would be lead in enforcing rule of law/norms
- contradicts:: [[Realism\|Realism]] reject importance of Norms because It’s in actors interests to violate them if its not in their interest.
    - not to strictly stick to norms/laws 
  >[!cautious]
  >International norms are violated during times of crisis and put ethics or moral issues first
