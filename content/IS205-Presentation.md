Influencing skills are a group of skills which combine and compliment each other in the purpose of attracting another person to change the way they think or act, and to cooperate with us.

Influencing is more and more useful now as you don't have to have the formal authority or power over someone's action to impact the way they behave and think.

Just as I said, influence is not a strict power over an individual, you might be able to convince or change their behavior but they are free to disagree and behave in whichever way they want. However, research shows that the effectiveness of our influence depends on four categories of skills, Communication and Reasoning, assertiveness, and interpersonal skills

# Communication and Reasoning Skills

To communicate effectively you have you try and understand both sides of the story no matter your bias. This way you can put yourself in someone else's shoes, and find a way to logically explain your reasons for thinking or behaving a certain way to maybe convince another person to change their perspective or just to respect and understand your reasoning.

If the contested idea is complex or confusing, it may be good to create charts, graphs, diagrams, or timelines to clearly visualize and guide them through your evidence without them losing focus.

The ability to think outside the box would also be beneficial to influence a person. You might be able to make creative examples and find solutions to break their conventional way of thinking.

Probing, probing is a sort of method of asking progressive questions step by step to get closer to the core of the differing opinion.

You can also influence people by just talking to them casually. Being able to converse on a number of topics means that you subconsciously inject your thoughts and opinions on certain matters to them.

Your mood and energy will also be contagious and makes others the same. If you're enthusiastic and energetic you'll surely bring up the mood and energy in a room.

And lastly, Listening is an important part of communicating. If a person feels you are actively listening and considering your opinions and points, they'll be willing to do the same to us.
