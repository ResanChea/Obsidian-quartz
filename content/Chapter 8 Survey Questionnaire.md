# 1. Surveys

Survey: a data collection tool in social science, posing questions to respondents

- It's versitile: flexible

Two forms of Survey

- Interview: questions posed person to person (phone/in person)
- Questionnair: self administered question answering

## Problems of respondent cooperation

- Respondense Rate: percentage of people who complete the survey
- Social Desirability: error caused by people answering
    - in a socially appropriate way, what is expected instead of reality
    - lie to make themselves look good, and hide bad things

# 2. The way we word things

Operational

- Concepts are measured through questions posed to subjects
- Careful exact wording of questions aiming for the right variable
    - Sensitivity: Welfare vs Poor, End Pregnancy vs Abortion

# 2. The Rules

## 2.1. Questions should be clear of ambiguity

Use precise language in questions: not subjective wordings

Do you exercise regularly? vs How many times do you exercise per week?

## 2.2. Use common language

- Don't use technical words: field specific jargon will only confuse people, use everyday words
- Don't use abbreviations: field specific abbreviations isn't commonly known and may be mis understood.

## 2.3. Use neutral language

- Don't use emotional facts, language, or phrases that seek empathy, fear, or pity
- Causing emotions could skew/bias an answer to the emotion instead of the issue itself

## 2.4. Use Simple to Answer Questions

The double barrel question: to ask two or more questions in disguise as one question.

Ex: How do you rate police response time to emergency and non-emergency calls?

# 3. The Structure of Questions

## 3.1. Closed Ended Questions

Questiosn for you to choose from a number of options available

- Advantage: Easier to answer for respondents
    - Save time to analyze
- Disadvantage: not exactly fit for all respondents
    - Options might not

Ex: Nominal & Ordinal level of measurement: provide fixed choices

Do you rent DVDs?

Traits of Closed Ended

- Exhaustivity: present all relevant response as a option to respondents
- Mutual exclusivity: each response options must not overlap each other
- Nominal level measures must be mutually exclusive and exhaustive

Level of agreement could be from 2 to 6

## 3.2. Open Ended Questions

Questions requiring repondents to give their own answer

- Advantage: better at getting clear and personalized answers from respondent
    - Uncover surprising element
- Disadvantage: lower response rate from respondents as it's longer to do
    - Unable to standardize
    - Difficult to code or analyze data

In the last two weeks, how many times have you rented dvds?

# 4. Putting it together

Demand repondents to supply requested informations. 

How? Certain questionnair formats could help

## 4.1. Cover Letter or Introduction

to sell your research, respondents to be interested to help

- Importance: how much it could impact society, that they are important part
- Legitimacy: how we will follow up and create meaningful results
- Confidentiality: anonimity and privacy should be addressed

Cover Letter

- Personalize: address name, catagories, or status
- Have personal signature of researchers
- Contain contact information
- Put cover letter on questionnair

## 4.2. Primacy Effects

"Item at the beginning of a list will stay in people's long term memory longer"

Don't start with a 

- demographic question (age, gender, edu)
- openended-questions

Do start with

- Interesting opinion
- Attitude questions: non-sensitive safe questions

## 4.3. Sequencing

Ordering your questions properly by catagorizing will help resondents not get confused

## 4.4. Logical Flow

Earlier questions could influence answer to later questions

- Grouping by time order
- Catagorizing
- Bring thought provoking question about the topic before asking the real question

How to deal with

- Determine sensitivity of the order
- Pre-test with trail respondents

## 4.5. What to ask and what not to

Filter Question: question that determine if repondent are supposed to skip or answer a question

Convert long questionnairs to shorter ones. 

Why: The longer the questionnair, the less the response rate

How: a questionnair shouldn't be more than 40 minuites long

The correct format: 

- not to be crammed
- give enough answer space

## 4.6. Formatting

Best layout to put questions

Resonse Set: questions that are worded the same into a pattern that could cause error

Mis match questions to

# 5. Pre-testing

think of format, logical flow of survey and tweak according to feedback

Pre test methods:

## 5.1. Cognitive Interview

### Think Aloud

- Repondents are asked to verbalize their answers
- non-directive and open-probing

### Directive and Probing

- Asking for open ended questions

# 6. Challenges to Mailed Questionnairs

Cover Letter: make easier response, that it's important enough to fill and send back

Make returning Easy and attractive: make short surveys, correct time, incentive rewards
