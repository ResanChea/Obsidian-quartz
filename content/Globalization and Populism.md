Type: Reading Notes

- Does globalization strengthen democracy & liberal values
    - it does, but it also strengthen authoritarian regimes, rulers, and oppressing forces
- Globalization creates the left behind because inequality of gain â‡’ fueled the populism idea to change that
- The Great Compression (Post-WW2): huge reduction of inequality of income and wealth across developed nations between 1914 to 1970s

- What is [[Populism\|Populism]]?

# 1. Relationships Between Globalization and Populism

- Driving forces behind globalization is unbundling:
    - the fall of the cost of things that connect the world
    - thereâ€™s no need for a production line to be performed next to each other using comparative advantage
- Migration rates increased
- Globalization entails growing inequality and insecurity in advanced countries.
- Trade and financial openness do not lead to higher economic growth
by themselves, in the absence of institutional reforms.
- The Trilemma: you can only have 2 out of the 3 at the same time
    1. Deep economic integration
    2. Nation-state
    3. Democratic politics
    - 1+3= global federalism: scope of democratic politics coincides with scope of global market
    - 1+2= address needs of international economy, but not domestic objectives anymore
        - economic interdependence creates exploitable vulnerability
        - only benefit some, not all
        - itâ€™s not easy to maintain this type of policy with a democratic regime (people will vote you out for more populist policy)
    - 2+3= limited version of globalization
        - What does this mean?

# 2. Concepts, Causes, and Consequences of Populism

- Populism is hard to define and subjective
    - term used by â€˜orthadoxâ€™ political parties against their opponents
- Populism: a political approach that strives to appeal to ordinary people who feel that their concerns are disregarded by established elite groups
    - components of definition of populism
        - populist claims to be on the side of the people against the elites
        - fear or enthusiasm: that politicians can pander to, seek their support through their concerns
        - disregard for future consequence: normally with political goals of short-term protections
            - only to get support of people short term
            - doesnâ€™t provide long term solutions
    - Characteristic:
        - Hostility to elites, mainstream politics, and established institutions
            - anti-institutionalism
        - taken up by both right and left wings
        - Society is separated into two antagonistic groups: pure people vs corrupt elites
- Historical perspective: investigate importance from political ideology and political strategies under the democratic system.

## what are the causes of the rise of populism

- rise of democracy
    - if a leader canâ€™t satisfy the people, they will elect a â€˜populistâ€™ leader to replace the old one
- After crises sometimes

# 3. How Globalization Fuels Populism

Globalization creates a few winners and a lot of losers

- Inequality created from this is the opportunity for populist leadersâ€™ rise
1. economic insecurity resulting from income distribution
    - for the poorer people: income gap
        - international economic growth policy will increase domestic inequality â‡’ populist leaders seek to slow down economic policies and focus more internal problems
    - globalization making states unable to deal with internationally natured problems, then must fall under the regulations developed by those international independent institutions
        - populism becomes more attractive as global integration develops
            - why?
        - nationalism, patriotism: donâ€™t want globalization
            - state failure: economic failure
            - fail or seek help from IOâ€™s help
                - weakness in leadership â‡’ populist leaders gain support
2. cultural insecurity mainly caused by immigration issues
    - Foster mobility of people
        - cultural backlash result from immigration
            - immigrants from unstable regions (middle east & africa) goes to Western countries with different customs and traditions
            - losing jobs: biased policies to foreign workers
        - leads to racism, xenophobia: those populism policies proposed by populist leaders are more important to some people than economic growth policies
            - Anti-immigration: linked to right-winged populism: Trump, Brexit, strengths of parties in Europe (nativist, nationalist, far-right, and even neo-fascists)

- Populist leaders usually turn to authoritarian to maintain power
    - They are elected by the people and therefore think they can do whatever they want

- Governments canâ€™t deal with lack of necessary institutions â‡’ creation of technocratic institutions that wants the interests of the nonelected groups of people & more estrangement of ordinary citizens
    - Why? what does that mean?
- Liberal democracy threatened by illiberal democracy and undemocratic liberalism
    - What are they? Why important?
