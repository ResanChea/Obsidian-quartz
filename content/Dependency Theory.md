- **Dependency Theory**: Global Governance, created by rich states, to ensure poor states continue to depend on rich states [^1]

	- Make sure the poor stays poor (economic independent)
	- Make sure the rich stays rich
		- Richer states can have influence on governance of poorer states through aid

- The Process [^2]
	- Developing countries export Primary Commodities: Unfinished products / Raw materials
	- Primary goods sold to rich, rich sells back more expensive value-added products [^3]
