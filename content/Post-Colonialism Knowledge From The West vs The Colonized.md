# Post-Colonialism: Knowledge From The West vs The Colonized

- Assumes knowledge: what is said to be true is never a full account of events
- Gaps between what is said to have happened and what actually happened
    
    â†’ explained by examining how colonial structures shape academic research
    


ðŸ’¡ Ex: European research for 'universal truths' with the world's natives as research subjects

Problems:

- Didn't involve use of native knowledge or concerns
- Findings not universally accessible: natives are illiterate and in poverty


Post-Colonialism disputed validity of **European justification for imperialism**

- The idea and commonplace of 'expert knowledge' about former colonial expanses
    
    â†’ Used to justify imperialism
    
- Propositions by [[Rationalism\|Rationalism]] & [[Critical Theory\|Critical Theory]] theorists that rationalism & humanism is enough context for critique of imperialism
    - The West thought it has sole responsibility for charting the course of human history
- Prevailing rationalities and historical justifications of imperialism
    
    â†’ self-serving assumptions 
    
- The scientific understanding of natives through their cultures with their customs, and habits as reflected by European's own 'caste of mind'
    
    â†’ divided humanity into races, ethnic groups, heathens, and barbarians
