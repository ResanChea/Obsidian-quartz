# Functionalism

- Functionalism assert that International **economic and social cooperation** between nations will lead to political cooperation and eliminating war.
	- governance (global or governmental) arise out of need of people or states.
	- In cooperating in non-sensitive areas
	- states can use IGOs to work together
	- eventually leading to more sensitive political cooperation
	- Early IGOs were developed for cross-border activities
	    - International Telegraph Union
	    - Universal Postal Union
	    - Commission for navigation on the Rhine River
	    - World Health Organization
	    - UN Children's Fund
	    - Food and Agriculture Organization
	    - International Labor Organization
    
- International Organizations here consist of limited amount of members, focusing on a certain area, either economic, social, or environmental problems.

- **Functional Relationship**: technical experts loses identification with their state, to allegiance of like-minded individuals.

- Like people, states develop functional relationships from economic cooperation

## Challenges With Functionalism

- EU will achieve common foreign and security policy. Political decisions may be needed, but actions may not be taken
- Decolonization process was important, but no IO created for it
- International organizations modified global political system, but not transform it
- How can other causes of war, besides economic deprivation, illiteracy, hunger, disease, be alleviated?
- In reality, cooperation spillovers aren't as easy or common as it's proposed.
