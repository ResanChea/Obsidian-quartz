Treaties are the primary source of international law, cooperation of states for mutual interests

- Treaties, conventions, protocols, covenants

**Treaties in History**

Before 1969, there were only customary International laws

Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) (1969) codified many laws

# 1. Define Treaty

A written international agreement concluded between states to address a certain topic.

**To qualify as a treaty**

- Written document signed by two or more parties
- Only parties with international personality
- Governed by international law
- Intended to create legal obligations

**Types of Actors**

- Members party:  + signed +ratify (binding)
- Signatory States: + signed - ratify (non-binding)
- Non-state party:  - signed - ratify (non-binding)

## 1.1. Two Types of Treaties

### 1.1.1. Bilateral Treaties

Process:

- Agreement proposed by one foreign ministry to the other country
- Discussion and preparation of one or more drafts
- Negotiation: is easier and faster to make bilaterally, to accept
- Sign: to consent to be bound by the treaty

**Entry into Force:** When both states signature the treaty, ratification only in important issues

### 1.1.2. Multilateral Treaties

Agreement between like-minded countries

- Diplomatic conferences for draft
- Negotiation: is harder due to more members ⇒ more conflicts
- The Final Act is the final draft to be voted into adoption
    - Voting is specified in document (50%+1 or 2/3...)
- Signature: differing state representative of each country to sign
- Ratify: formal process of consenting to treaty (VCLT 35 votes)
    - Domestic procedures to ratify
        - Bring agreement to senate
        - Evaluate cost/benefits
        - King/head of state to sign the document

**Entry into Force**: When enough signatures by member states (as said in document)

# 2. Process of a Treaty

- Negotiation
- Treaty must be registered with UN organ before ratified
    - UN treaty collection: to be published and not be secret
    - to be able to use UN's ICJ as dispute settlement mechanism
- The Final Act is the text of the treaty to be voted into adoption
- Sign: to accept the final form or draft of the agreement
- Ratify: to formally accept the treaty
    
    Why Ratification?
    
    For checks and balance between all bodies of government
    
- Enter into force

## Accession (Acceptance/Approval)

Method by which states consent to be bound by/join a treaty which has already been negotiated

- Domestic [[assets/Chapter 12 - lmgu0ltd7wa/Difference/Procedures\|procedures]] for accession to enter into force too

# [[Reservation\|Reservation]]

A statement made by a state to which article it accepts and which it does not accept.

A state may be a member state even if it doesn't accept some article of the treaty.

- Some important points are required to be agreed to be a member
- Reservation available articles are stated by the treaty itself

# 3. Declaration

A milder reservation

A Declaration is a statement that the states will implement and perform the article they the way it sees fit, without interpretation from others.

- Performs all articles but in their own way or extent

Example: (Treaty) Free health care for all.

Reservation: Free health care, but not for everyone...

Declaration: to perform free healthcare but to the capability of the state's economy.

---

After ratification, Reservation and Declaration happens at the same time.

# 4. Observance of Treaties

How states perform and implement treaties

As a state party, states have obligations bound by the treaty

- Must be performed in good faith: honesty and fairness

# 5. Interpretation

States must interpret treaties in good faith

- Interpreting the original meaning when it was created
- Normally though, states interpret it in their interests
    
    In interpreting past treaties, states will find exploitable meanings in their favor
    

# 6. Grounds of Invalidity

Reasons which can makes a treaty invalid

## 6.1. Absolute Reason of Validity

100% invalid without a doubt

- Any treaty that contradict '[[Jus Cogens\|Jus Cogens]]' is 100% invalid

## 6.2. Relative Reason of Validity

Reasons that has gray areas, interpretable by ICJ

- Error: signed treaties that has unintentional errors on statistics, numbers, facts
- Fraud: treaty that has intentional errors by a cheater state.
- Corruption: when state's representative are bribed into signing or not signing a treaty
- Coercion: to force a state into an agreement
    1. forcing a state representative to sign using deadly threat. 
    2. Putting deterrent in not signing the treaty for interest of state

# 7. Termination & Suspension

Termination: stop practicing treaty forever

Suspend: to stop practicing for a period of time

By Consent

- A member could be terminated when all other members agrees or consent to

By Violation (Material Breach)

- If a state violate article of the treaty, other member could request for termination/compensation of violator

- In conformation with the treaty
- By consent of all parties

# 9. State Succession

## 9.1. Merger of Two States

- The treaty takes after the country which ideology/practice that the new country takes after

## 9.2. Newly Independent State

- The NIS can start everything anew, no need for adopting parent state's treaty

## 9.3. Successor States
