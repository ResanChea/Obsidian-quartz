    - Contemporary warfare is being influenced by [[Globalization\|Globalization]] 
        - As the world is now interconnected, wars are hard and too costly to manage than just cooperating or solving arguments peacefully

## [[Clausewitz says war is a political instrument\|Clausewitz says war is a political instrument]]
- Friction is common in war: there’s always small incidents that’s uncontrollable which slow down the planned objective.
- **Total War**: every single person in the state have a role to play in the war 
	- How to know if a war is total?
	- Whether the political objective of opponent is limited/unlimited
	- You have to match or go over the political objective of the opponent

    - World domination: Christian Crusade
    - Ethnic domination: Nazi-Germany
    - Ideological Conviction: Al-Qaeda

## 1.3. Cataclysmic Philosophy

- Cataclysmic Philosophy: wars are natural disaster.
    - Inevitable: There’s no point in trying to prevent it.
    - You can only slow down or reduce its damage
        - using [[International Institution\|International Institution]], Rules, Laws, Norms: [[Human Rights\|Human Rights]]

# 2. The New Traditions of War

## 2.1. The “New War” Tradition

- After Cold War ended, Clausewitz is criticized: leading to ‘**New War**’ movement
- The “New War” Tradition: traditional assumptions can’t explain actors, dynamic, goals, and resolution potentials anymore
    - State & Non-State Actors:
        - internal armed conflicts happen far more often that inter-state conflicts
        - actors are no longer states
            - Guerrilla, Somalia Pirate, Uniformed Soldier, Terrorist, Private Security Company, Child Soldier
    - goal is no longer political:
        - Ethnic and Religious violence
        - Profit
    - resource can be got from forcing civilians than state
        - No longer distinction between civilians and combatants
    - Hard to bring to an end

- Counterinsurgency and War of pacification

## 2.2. The “Spectator Sport” tradition

- The “Spectator Sport” tradition: war has become a game for Western countries
    - 3 Transformation in Wars
        1. Global conflicts is no longer possible
        2. Political goal of the war is no longer total, but now only limited
            - Governing a country is harder than winning it
            - When great powers are bored they leave the conflict. Such as in the [[War in Afghanistan\|War in Afghanistan]]
        3. War doesn’t need passion of people anymore
            - Civilians are willing to pay tax to hire conscripts instead of fighting the war themselves
            - Drone strikes, plane bombings instead of Infantry or soldiers on the ground
