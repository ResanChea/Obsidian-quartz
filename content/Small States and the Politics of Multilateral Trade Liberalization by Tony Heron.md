# Small States and the Politics of Multilateral Trade Liberalization by Tony Heron
doi: https://doi.org/10.1080/00358530801962063

- Examines position of small states in the global politics of trade and development
	- issue of multilateral trade liberalization and distributional consequences of it for small states
	- focus on the role of policy regimes in shaping the timing, form and the economic consequences of trade reform

- Two different debates
	- Consensus that [[Laissez-Faire\|Laissez-Faire]] is the only way out of poverty
	- The developing world is split in two
		- The relatively competitive developing countries are more likely to prosper under freer trade
		- Those small states who still rely on preferential markets will suffer under freer markets
	- Problem: size isn't the only determinant here, which isn't discussed in both debates.

- The prosperity distribution of small states in freer trade politics depends not on size or resource endowment
	- How much natural resources it have
- Trade policy is more important: liberal, protectionist, preferential...
	- Which becomes embedded in regimes
	- actual dependence on preferential trade and 
		- the level of export diversification
			- Both can be influenced by political and institutional influences




## Definition of political economy of small states

- Smallness != lack of economic development
- Small states generally have higher income and productivity levels than larger states because
	- A higher degree of social cohesion
	- Small agriculture sector
	- Higher levels of foreign aid per head
	- Much higher ratios of trade to GDP
		- High exposure to international trade means it can specialize in labour-intensive economic activities to balance out its small domestic market.
		- Problem: as small states specialize in one or two commodities to export
			- it is vulnerable to external economic forces & activities
			- They're not dominant producer -> can't determine international price of commodity

## Small states and the politics of multilateral trade liberalization

- Small states rely disproportionately on non-reciprocal, preferential trade agreements.
	- Preferential Trade Agreements: low or no export tarriffs 
- For example, the ACP accounts only for 2% of the EU's imports
	- But for most of the African, Carribean, and Pacific (ACP) members, its trade with the EU takes up significant fractions of its GDP
	- 22% of GDP Fiji
- There are new challenges to abolish preferential trade comes from the WTO multilateral trade system who is trying to further liberalize the world's economy
	- Reforms for other reasons
		- EU's banana regime
		- Collapse of communism in Europe
- Larger developing countries have incentive to stop preferential trade regimes because it denies them access to major markets of the US and EU
	- Larger developing states 

## Case Study of Textiles and Clothes (T&C)

- How recent liberalization of T&C sector led to problems for developing countries to adjust to freer trade. The problem doesn't only rely on size, sectoral trade regime and modes of liberalization are also important.


- Key Words
	- Preferential Market Access: Refers to the fact that certain exporters pay lower or no tariffs on their exports to a given **market**, either because their country of origin has an FTA with the importing country, or because the latter has accorded them special **access** by virtue of their country’s low level of development and/or their adoption of certain policies to support more sustainable development.
