Dear [Mr./Ms./Mx.] [Hiring Manager’s Last Name],

In the first paragraph, introduce yourself. Let the employer know who you are, why you’re interested in working for the company and what your professional experience is.

The second paragraph should describe your industry-specific qualifications. Include your relevant experience and skills. This is where you want to highlight your most impressive achievements using hard numbers to quantify them.

-   If you want to draw attention to several key accomplishments, you can use a bulleted list
-   Add numbers to the bullet points to make them more memorable
-   Include hard skills that will prove valuable to the company

The final paragraph is your “call to action”. Tell the hiring manager how they can reach you (be specific – include your phone number and/or email address), and that you look forward to an opportunity to tell them more about your qualifications. Thank them for their time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Your Name
