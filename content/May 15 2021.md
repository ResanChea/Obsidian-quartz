Cheer ≠ Chill

Eye contact

Remember your script

- Make it sound natural
- Speed up most of your speech
- Only slow down when it's an important point you want your audience to notice or remember
- Don't rely on reading script, You can use your own words on simple points
- How priceless volunteers are? ⇒ How are volunteers priceless?

No slides for points of benefits for volunteer

Add source for images

- Multiple pictures in one site from the same website can have only one source

# Sreypech

You mentioned there are solutions to both systematic racism and individual racism but didn't further elaborate, but started to explain systematic racism instead. it should be moved back for flow

- talking is a bit slow, when every thing sounds like its an emphasis, it starts blurring together of what's important and what's not so important
- time limit is a bit too long
