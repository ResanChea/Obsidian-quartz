History of Asia democratization process

    - South-East Asia
    - South Asia
    - East Asia
- 1974: only 4 countries in Asia are electoral democracies (6%)
- 2002: progress increased democratization to 40%
    - the degree of democracy is still uncertain and unconsolidated regime
        - failed or unstable democracy
        - **full of problems**: violation of rule of law, corruptions

# Causes of Defective Democracy

There's no single primary cause but multiple

## Socio-economic determinants

- Economic prosperity and political freedom
    
    
    ðŸ’¡ Outliers Cases: Brunei & Singapore
    
    
    
- Socio-economic challenges are defects for democracy
- High GDP per capita â‰  doesn't always mean better political freedom

## Cultural and historical legacies

- Political culture and legacies of colonialism affects the country's possibility of democracy
    - indoctrination: left over blueprints for political structure
- Asian Values: of sovereignty first and wariness of the west (because colonization)
    
    
    ðŸ’¡ Most Ex British colonies didn't adopt liberal democracy
    
    - Limited sample makes the correlation uncertain
    
    

## Stateness and nation-building

- Territories
- Authority
- National Unity

## Political institution

- Presidentialism is claimed to be detrimental to the consolidation of liberal constitutionalism
- It's hard to determine what works best, we have to look at the broader institutional framework
- Strength, types, of leaders, legislative power vested to president, veto players, ...

# The Future of Democratization Process in Asia

- Positive
    - Ending of communism and socialist revolution mark as no death threats toward democracy
    - Militay elites doesn't get any further support from the west
    - Citizens are not willing to go back under authoritarian regime again
- Negative
    - That will be difficult for those South and Southeast Asia to shift toward liberal democracy if economic prosperity, distribution of wealth and social power resources as well as stateness are the real causes of defective democracy
    - If these problems still persist, most Asia countries are unlikely to democratize.
