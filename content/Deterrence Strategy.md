# Deterence Strategy
- [[Deterrence\|Deterrence]] strategies ended up leading to the *immediate challenges* it seeked to deter through [[Security Dilemma\|Security Dilemma]]
## Immediate Deterrence
- Immediate Deterrence: attempt to delay the anticipated challenge from an enemy who is well-defined and with pubicized commitment
	- Critique: [[Cognitive Fallacy\|Cognitive Fallacy]] that makes leaders test opponent's resolve even risking national suicide. (happened in [[Cuban Missile Crisis\|Cuban Missile Crisis]])
	- The Cold War ended not because the shift in balance of power, but because Gorbachev's New Thinking and rational decisions ([[Cold War#Why did the Cold War End 1\|Cold War#Why did the Cold War End 1]])

## General Deterrence
- When general deterrence fails, the opponent wants to challenge status quo.
	- Leading to Immediate Deterrence where both sides try to reassure each other and stepped down from the brink
	- Ex: in the case of the [[Cold War\|Cold War]] leading to the [[Cuban Missile Crisis\|Cuban Missile Crisis]] 
- The role of General Nuclear Deterrence
	>1. Leaders who try to exploit real or imagined nuclear advantage for political gain are not likely to succeed
	>2. Credible nuclear threats are very difficult to make
	>3. Nuclear threats are "filled" with risk
	>4. Strategic build-ups are more likely to provoke than to restrain adversaries because of their impact on the domestic balance of political power in the target state ([[Security Dilemma\|Security Dilemma]])
	>5. Nuclear deterrence is robust when leaders on both sides fear war and are aware of each other's fears
### Cases of General Deterrence
