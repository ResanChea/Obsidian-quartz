# Introduction

## 1. Westphalian Framework

ASEAN holds treaty of Westphalia (1648) $\approx$ ASEAN Way

- Respect of sovereignty
- Non-interferance
- Saving Face
- Consensus Decision making

## 2. Problems

- Internal Conflict: compete for stronger/survival, picking sides
- Zero-sum game
- Weak: No decision-making/enforcement power

# II. State as Actor

ASEAN is a states' agent: a tool for states to pursue national interests.

- National Interests $<$ Regional Norm
- Member States are who have decision making powers, ASEAN doesn't
- ASEAN doesn't represent all member states in dealings internationally

# III. ASEAN as an Agent of States

Contradicted Theories:

- Constructivism: "Structures comes from collective value and identity"
- Liberalism: "States cooperate, and IOs are influential"

Fits Theory:

- Realism: "States are self-interested, IOs are tools for states, lack of cooperation"

# IV. The ASEAN Community

ASEAN remained the same since before 2015

- "Old wine in new bottle"
- Ineffective system/regional organization

# V. The Non-traditional Agenda

ASEAN nations express support for democratic norms and human rights

But:

- Endorsement is not implemented by those same leaders in ASEAN nations
- Supporting western norms to gain international support

---

ASEAN Way does not support democracy 

- Consensus based â‰  majority based

# VI. Transformation in the Regional and International Environment

ASEAN only deal with insensitive issues and ignore each other's wrong doings

ASEAN cannot deal with crisis only balance power or preventive methods

# VII. The Subordinate Regional States System

Subordinate Role: ASEAN seek world powers to rely on to balance major power competition

- ASEAN member states act separately by supporting different super powers
- ASEAN could break down if the [[role of 'Consensus'\|role of 'Consensus']] continue to disrupt collective decision-makings
