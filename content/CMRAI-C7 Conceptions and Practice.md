# Interest Based Bargaining

Interest based approach is the utilitarian value of the "greatest good to the greatest number"

- Are suitable for deputes that do not involve widespread violence, confrontations with authorities, or defiance of legal norms
- Discourage the use of emotions
- A compromise (division of loss vs gain) is obtained through mediation or negotiation
- Not appropriate for disputes with underlying grievances, deeper concern, tension, or emotions.
- Not through busy bureaucratic court system, but through mediation, quicker & cheaper

# Needs based approach
