# Data Mining
- [[Data\|Data]] Mining: is training an algorithm with a dataset that we know both the [[Independent Variable\|Independent Variable]] and [[Dependent Variable\|Dependent Variable]] of. Then Using it on a new dataset to predict the unknown IV 
## Data Mining Methods
- Decision Trees Analysis: used to classify and sub-classify data to predict what possibilities of their [[Independent Variable\|IV]] could be

# Regression Analysis
- Checks if, and by how much [[Independent Variable\|Independent Variable]]  (s) affect [[Dependent Variable\|Dependent Variable]] 
	- $R^2$ (0-1) the % that the IV(s) account for the changes in the DV >0.5
	- Significance (Sig.) must be <0.05 to be statistically significant
	- Coefficient: the percentage of each the independent variables is responsible for changes in the dependent variable
	- Standard Error: amount by which the coefficient varies across different cases
	- t-value of the test and its value: is equal to the coefficient divided by the standard error.

- Artificial Neural Networks: AI & ML learns from large amounts of past data to predict future data
- Cluster Analysis: dividing a database into clusters grouped by similarities/dissimilarities to divide and conquer large databases
- Associate Rule Mining: some data values can commonly be found together such as Toothpaste and Toothbrushes, which can be put into the same bucket and more likely to be sale bundled together
- Text Mining
