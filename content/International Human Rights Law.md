	- Importance of IHR shouldn't be about if it achieve its goal of eliminating human rights abuses...
		- It should be about if its useful and adding to the utility belt of groups and bodies that can use it. 
			- If its valuable or not. If it didn't exist would it be worse?
	- Development of IHR is still in its infancy. It will show its effectiveness at maturity.
		- At this point it already has shown remarkable change in the world.
	- Context matters: IHR shouldn't be expected to work in all places at all times.
