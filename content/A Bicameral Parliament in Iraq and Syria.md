# In Constitution creation

- a democracy in the worse case will be to fill the legislative branch with representatives of the majority
- bicameralism must be used:
    1. accepting the opinion of the majority as expressed in free, transparent elections for the Council of Representatives.
    2. enabling community groups who do not have a numerical majority to manage their own local affairs and have an influential say in national decision-making.
