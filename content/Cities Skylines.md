# City Idea

- Name stuff after your own city and locations around you, translate the names to english and base the towns and names on it
    - Like ថ្កូវ: [Nauclea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nauclea) Market
    
# Common Issues I Solved

- Half the city was sick, I kept building hospitals and managing the health budget, but it didn’t help
    - It ended up being the water pump being down stream from the sewage drain as I was suggested from Steam forums
