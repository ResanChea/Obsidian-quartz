Game Theory: application of mathematical models to understand interactions among actors in IR

Formal Methods contributed a lot here

Cold War urged this method to predict strategic actions of enemies

How to create a model

- Reducing the problem to itś basic elements
- Different choices → multiple different outcomes

If you're picking a restuarant to eat at by the preference of your friend using ordinal preference, just majority wins

If you look at intensity of preference too you use the Cardinal Preference. To keep the group together you must choose the least conflicted one
