# Intro

Trade integration has key areas of concerns

- Trade
- Finnance
- Investment

Trade integration in multilateral trade in Asia between

- Market-led integration:
- State-led integration: fta, custom unions

# Market-led Integration

- Trade integration in Asia pushed mainly by market, not government
- Assumes that state doesn't contribute much to increase trade integration in the region

China became main partner in Asia

## Increase in trade integration in Asia

|2006: Asian accounted for 1/3 of world trade

|1990-2009: integration between Asia $\uparrow$9x

|2009: Share of intra-East and SEA export account for 41% of overall trade. Imports at 49%

# Why has the support for multilateral regulation of trade disappeared?

WTO wasn't participated by Asia much in the 1960s?

**Bretton Wood System**

- in case of financial crisis in a country: they could borrow from IMF and World Bank
- Failed: because dollar kept increasing in value and gold kept shrinking

GATT

- To promote international trade by reducing or eliminating trade barriers (tarriffs or quotas)
- Led to Establishment of WTO

GATT became important

- US: saw GATT as beneficial before WW2
- EU:
- Asia:

## The US national interest

Bush admin:

Clinton Admin: gentle trade involvement?

Obama Admin: support free trade

First 2 decades: US was #1 supporter, Europe #2 supporter of GATT

## The World Trade Organization

Created in 1995 with set of principles of 

- Market liberalization: open world to internationalized trade system
- Non-discrimination: each member has the same opportunities, rejecting 'most-favored-nation' treatment

Acted s dispute settlement mechanism to ensure compliance in trade agreements

# The Mushrooming of trade agreement in Asia

FTA spread to Asia

- China became most active in bilateral trade
- China and ASEAN created world largest Free Trade Zone

## Asia changing to economic focus

The Asian financial crisis shifted Asia's focus from regional security â†’ economic integration and stability

Why?

- traditional security is no longer important
- economic instability is a greater concern than traditional risks
- economies in Asia is growing closer together: share intra-regional trade
- Political rivalry between China and Japan stimulated Asian regionalism and PTAs

# The limited utility of preferential trade agreement

Limited utility of preferential trade agreement is burdened by "rules of Origin"

Rules of Origin: where goods have been produced or manufactured

- Intermediate goods from country A to put together in country B would create a product with the Origins from country B

Used to

- Developing countries: enhance economic development
- Developed countries: protect aging domestic industries

## 4 Methods of Establish the ntionality of the product

Natural Origin: raw materials and non-processed agricultural products

Substantial Transformation

Tariff Heading: recevies a tariff heading after the production is processed to qualify the origin

Minimum Value-added rule: a % of the value of the product must be produced in the FTA

Production Process: production processes that is identified and agreed to be established in the origin

# Should Asian economies consider custom unions?

Open Trading Regime: reginal economic integration without discrimination against economies outside the region

- Problem: Open regionalism is unclear

Discriminating Preferential Trade Agreement: PTA not to discriminate against members but to do so for non-members

- Problem: there are more convincing alternatives?

Customs Union: eliminate trade barriers
