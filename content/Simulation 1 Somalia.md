# Background of the Issues in Somalia

## Social Problems Backgrounds

    - Somalia is hosting refugees from many countries
    - Reasons
        - Extreme Weather
        - civil war Violence
        - stolen humanitarian aid

## Proposed Solutions

    Does solving the refugee crisis in Somalia help US national interest? What do we want to happen?
    

## Terrorism

- Active terrorism of Al-Shabab (a branch of Al-Queda)
    - Help of training by US counter terrorisms
        - Recently withdrew troops and training
        - Still some commanders remain to train Somalian security though
    - Al-Shabab uses violence and threats to recruit
        - Stopping violence against civilians now
        - But still fight national government
    - the Al-Shabab in destabilizing the country
        - The delayed election
        - Distrust in Federal Govt by the state govt
    - Attacks humanitarian groups from UN and AU
        - Spend more funding to protect them

## Solution

How much does the US care about terrorism?

- US uses the argument that the situation of violence and security already got better from the US's help, and they don't need the help anymore
- The US does not really care about terrorism because if it does care, it would not withdrew the troop.
