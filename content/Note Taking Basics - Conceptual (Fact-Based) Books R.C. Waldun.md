### Summary of main points

1. When reading a fact based book, start by reading it as fast as possible while leaving quick highlights and notes.
2. Second read, find the small details and attach them to what you understood the first round (anchor points).
3.  Take note on first your anchor points, then attach the details in a way that replicates how your brain understood the chapter.

### Highlights and Notes

> "Do not let knowledge be memorized, but instead let concepts transform how you view the world"
> 
- When reading a fact based book such as history, theories, and chapters, try to do an **inspectional reading** first without stopping long to write anything (similar to [[Note Taking Basics - Fiction and Novels   R.C. Waldun\|Note Taking Basics - Fiction and Novels   R.C. Waldun]])
    - Focus on getting the full picture, highlight the pop out details, jot down one sentence notes in the book itself
    - Lightning bolt moments only can be found when you read things without stopping (20 pages in under 10 minutes)
    - Reading for the main turning points of each section will create anchor points that is useful for later
- Analytical Reading: reading for the small details and glossed over parts and attach them to the anchor points created by inspectional reading. The little details will make sense when you know how they relate to the anchor and other smaller details.
- When you take note to reflect your mental connections and processes it will only take reading one part of your note to recall everything in that note
