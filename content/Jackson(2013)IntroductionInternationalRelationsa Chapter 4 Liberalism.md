# [[references/Introduction to international relations_ theories and approaches by Robert H. Jackson, Georg S√∏rensen (2012)\|Jackson(2013)IntroductionInternationalRelationsa]] Chapter 4: Liberalism

# I. Early Study of IR and Liberalism

## Woodrow Wilson

- [Democratic peace theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_peace_theory): Democratic States don't go to war with one another
    
    factors are held as motivating peace between democratic states:
    
    - Democratic leaders are forced to accept responsibility for war losses to a voting public;
    - Publicly accountable statespeople are inclined to establish diplomatic institutions for resolving international tensions;
    - Democracies are not inclined to view countries with adjacent policy and governing doctrine as hostile;
    - Democracies tend to possess greater public wealth than other states, and therefore avoid war to preserve infrastructure and resources.
    
    **Criticism:** Relations among democracies could be from the bipolar side of the Cold War with the Democratic US.
    
- International Institutions: can be used to promote peaceful cooperation among states

## Normal Angell

**The Great Illusion:** many statecrafters believe winning the war will provide benefits

- Territorial conquest is expensive and politically divisive to operate, even winning is a loss

- Secret Diplomacy is  Dealt between governments without criticism from public/civilian

- Public Diplomacy requires agreements to be sensible and fair to be accepted by the public
- Human beings are **rational**
- The league of Nation's members assured each other of their peaceful intensions

## The "Fall of Liberalism"

- Rise of dictatorship by Italy, Germany, and Europe
- Authoritarianism in Central and Eastern Europe
- Powerful democracies had colonies abroad
- The League of Nations never became the powerful IO it aimed to be

# II. Basic Assumptions of Liberalism

Key Terms: Cooperation, Integration, Democracy, Peace...

Created in the 1910s

---

- Individuals share **mutual interests** will cooperate for mutual benefits
- Reason and mutual cooperation could solve conflicts peacefully
- There's always further progress for individuals and international relations between states to grow

**Extra Reading 4 Basic Principles of Ideal Liberalism:**

- Citizens' [Legal Equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_before_the_law), Civic Rights: Freedom of religion, free speech
- Sovereignty of state upholding civic rights without influence from Monarch or Military in foreign Policy
- Recognition of rights of Private Property
- The economy is shaped by supply and demand without strict control by governments

## 1. [[Sociological Liberalism\|Sociological Liberalism]]

Rejects realist's view that International Relations is only between states.

Support the concept of Transnationalism

**Transnationalism** International Relations conducted by states are influenced by relations among private individuals, groups, and societies.

- Provide Peace, Stability...
- Similar to Pluralism: actors apart from states also influence international relations

---

### James Rosenau

International Relations conducted by states are influenced by relations among private individuals, groups, and societies.

**Transnationalism** produce effects on global affairs:

- Better education, accessibility to tech, communication, travel allow more extended activities
- The complex world makes state's control over their citizens lessen, citizen's ties to their state is weak (multi centric > state centric)

### Richard Cobden

International Peace and stability is better maintained by private individuals of each states rather than the state people.

### Karl Deutsch

High Mutual interests/transnational ties can lead to "security communities" pursuing the same interests by cooperating as one. (NATO...)

Condition for emergence of security communities are

1. Increasing social communication
2. Greater Mobility of persons
3. Stronger economic ties
4. Wide range of mutual human transactions

### John Burton

Realism's Billiard balls less likely to collide but will produce big impact if collided.

The Cobweb Model: many different groups of individuals have overlapping ties to each other ‚áí lessening and minimizing the impacts of conflicts

# IV. Interdependence Liberalism

- actors depend on one another
	- Transnational ties makes interdependence
	- üïäÔ∏è The increase in interdependence means the increase in peace

- Currently Actors to be powerful
	- Don't need to have territory, military, natural resources
	- Need qualified labor force, access to information, financial capital

## High division of labor

- Separate actors specializing themselves in what they're good at and trading with produce which they're not good at producing

- It discourage conflicts as states rely on one another: interdependence makes cooperation more valuable
- Less likely to use military to solve conflicts: trade agreements and reliance on supply chain makes it a bad decision to go to war
    
    - Less Developed Countries are more likely to use military to solve conflicts than richer ones
    

## 1. Functionalist Theory

greater transnational ties could lead to peace

**Technical Experts**, not politicians, should manage cooperation, find solutions to solve them rationally

## 2. Neofunctionalist Theory

**Politicians** should lead cooperation by shifting their interests to agreeable state...

Spillover: increased cooperation in one area will lead to increase in cooperation in surrounding area.

## 3. Post-war complex interdependence

High-politics: the state interests of survival, balance of power, and self interests (less important)

Low-politics: the states focus on matters less important than survival of state (more important)

### Implications

1. States pursue separate goals from their transnational actors
2. Power Resources impacts regionally
- IGO's importance will increase:
    - weak states need platform to raise their voice
    - Coalitions formations
    - IOs will set international agendas

# V. Institutional Liberalism

International Institutions can make cooperation easier and likelier to happen, not guarantee  cooperation

Institutions aren't just scraps of papers

- Ineffective institutions are made to be used by states, not created properly

**Types of Institutions**

1.  
2. Institution (organization): a forum with infrastructure for meetings and negotiations
3. Institution (rules): international laws or principles for trade, human rights

**How it leads to peace**

- Institution provide opportunity and way to cooperate
- Institutions allow a way for states to monitor and take account of one another
- ...?

**Why institutionalism?**

- High Institutionalization stabilize anarchy made by multipolar system
- More transparency and increase trust between states
- A platform or forum to negotiate

# VI. Republican Liberalism

democratic states are more peaceful and law-abiding

- Democratic states don't fight other democratic states

## Why?

- Democratic states are controlled by the citizens, citizen will go out of their way to avoid war through peaceful settlements
- 'Pacific Union' are common values held by democratic states which is peaceful conflicts resolution
- Economic cooperation and interdependence will strengthen peace

# VII. Liberalism and World Order

5 Values of Western Order:

- Security co-binding: states are bound by institutions
- Penetrated reciprocal hegemony: both hegemon and the lower states are influenced by one another
- Semi-sovereign and partial great powers: certain great powers in certain areas, not all (economic, trade, not military)
- Economic openness: ...?
- Civic identity: ...?
