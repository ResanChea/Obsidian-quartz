# I. Unemployment rate

$Unemployment\ Rate\% = \frac{Number\ of\ Unemployed}{Labor Force}$

Labor Force: Employed + Unemployed

the natural rate of unemployment the normal rate of unemployment around which the unemployment rate fluctuates (4.9%)

cyclical unemployment the deviation of unemployment from its natural rate

# II. Labor Force Participation Rate

$Labor\ Force\ Participation\ Rate=\frac{Labor\ Force}{Adult\ Population}\times100$

The bigger the labor participation rate the better the economy.

Either the employed and unemployed can and will contribute to the economy through their income, spending, labor produced.

## Problems

### 1. Discouraged workers

individuals who would like to work but have given up looking for a job

### 2. Frictional unemployment

 unemployment that results because it takes time for workers to search for the jobs that best suit their tastes and skills. It explains the small fluctuations in employment data.

- Sectorial Shift: the drop in employment in one field and an increase in employment in another field caused by the same situation (oil price drop, automobile^, oil productionv)
- Public Policy: Government's program in matching employers with employees and to train the unemployed for a new industry.
    - Employment Agencies
    - Public Training Program
- Non-governmental Employment Opportunities: account for most of job search
    - Internet, Newspapers, Word of mouth, Online Job Sites

### 3. Structural unemployment

unemployment that results because the number of jobs available in some labor markets is insufficient to provide a job for everyone who wants one. This explains the more dramatic and longer changes in employment data. `(Ls>Ld)`

- Shift in technology focus, sectorial focus `(garment focus â‡’ industrial focus)`
- Unfair wage difference between two jobs with the same requirements will bring the wage down to the same
    
    Employees moving to the higher wage job â‡’ Supply of labor for higher-wage job increase â‡’ Supply curve shift right â‡’ equilibrium shifts to the same level

### 4. Marginally attached workers

are people who either have had jobs or searched for jobs in the last year, but have stopped seeking employment. They still want a job in the future.

### 5. Underemployment

people who have jobs which they are overqualified for, or aren't utilized to their full potential.

# III. Unemployment Benefits


ðŸ’¡ unemployment insurance a government program that partially protects workersâ€™ incomes when they become unemployed. Taking the pressure of searching for a suitable job, to avoid underemployment



## Problems

- Increase Unemployment: because people
    - put less effort to getting new jobs
    - are likely to turn down job opportunities
- People are less likely to want guarantee of job security during job search

# IV. Union

Group of workers in the same field demand firms for better wage.

Unionized workers have more impact on firms than non-unionized workers.

## Problems

- Increase in wage will force firms to fire more and hire fewer workers (un-unionized workers impacted the most) â‡’ Supply of Work falls
- The increase in wage of one industry will lead to a decrease in wage in another industry
    
    Better wage in Industry1 â‡’ unemployment in Industry1 â‡’ more supply of labor in industry 2 â‡’ less wage in Industry2
