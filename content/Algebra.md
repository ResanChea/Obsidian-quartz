# Algebra
- Algebra is based on [[Abstract\|Abstract]] ideas to explain things that are intangible like economics, norms, theories...

# Polynomial

- **Polynomial** (*many names/terms*): a sum of a finite number of terms. Conditions to be a polynomial are:
	- **Variable**: (ex: $x, y, a, b$) letters used to represent an unknown number
	- **Term**: each item in the formula ($+3x^2$, $-8x^1$, $+7x^0$)
	- **Exponent**: the power of the x (2, 1, 0)
		- All term's exponent must be positive to be a polynomial
	- **Coefficient**: the multiplier of the X (+3, -8, +7)
		- All coefficients must be an integer to be polynomial (not fractions: $x^{1\over2}$ or an integer: $x^{\sqrt{a}}$)

- Types of Polynomials
	- Monomial: 1 term (ex: $6x^0$)
	- Binomial: 2 terms (ex: $9a^2-5$)
	- Trinomial: 3 terms(ex: $+3x^2-8x^1+7x^0$)
- **Degrees of polynomial**: is the highest coefficient seen in all the terms of the polynomial
	- We can say $3y^3+5y$ is "A third degree binomial"
- Normally we write polynomials in the **standard form**: where degrees count down from left to right, highest to lowest
	- $10x^7+15x^3-9x^2+9$

# Average Rate of Change

- Is a type of exercise that asks for the average rate of change in a function $f(x)$ over the interval of $[n, m]$
	- It's represented by $\Large{\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}=\frac{y(x_f)-y(x_i)}{x_f-x_i}}$
