# Fortress Embassy

- Fortress Embassy: looks like military barracks
	- For insecure situations
		- Ex: after bombing incidents.
		- Ex: Country in war.
## Functions of the Fortress Embassy
Functions are the same, only different in construction design of its premises
- Safety designs against acts of [[Terrorism\|terrorism]] 
- spacious sites set back at least 100 feet from any surrounding streets
- concentration on the ‘compound’ of all non-military personnel;
- blast-proof construction
- high perimeter walls
- vehicle arrest barriers;
- (should all else fail) strengthened safe rooms resembling the ‘keep’ in a Norman castle to which all personnel might retreat.
## Problems of the Fortress Embassy
- Expensive to construct
- Can still have insecurity during travels: hotels, meetings
- Directly shows mistrust between states, might not promote relations
	- Negative local perception of embassy (scary, hostile)
		- Can't influence policy of host state through locals
	- Disrespective to local authority: feeling they can't protect the embassy
