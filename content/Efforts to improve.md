# Self fulfilling prophecy

if you don't believe you can do something in the first place, you wont even try, therefore never had a chance to do it in the first place.

# Blame yourself

> "You're only able to fix it when you take responsibility and start to make yourself accountable for your own problems"
> 
- Self reflect on how you failed
    - why
    - what did you do wrong
    - what you could've done better
