# Ethnicity


- ethnicity encompasses ascriptive groups whose members in the groups are typically assigned at birth and is difficult to change.
- an ethnic group share
    - a common name
    - a believed common descent
    - elements of a shared culture (or religion)
    - common historical memories
    - Most often language

- Different views on ethnic identity
    1. Primordial
        - Go hundreds/thousands years back: ancient hatred
            - Only solution: to divide society on ethnic lines
        - Unchangeable: stories and hatred passed down from older generations
        - Nested/overlapping identities
    2. Instrumental
        - Identities can change based on context or what happens
        - Can be used as an instrument to get to a goal of unity, strength, uniqueness, patriotism
            - Creation of artificial differentiation between ethnicities of ‘us against them’

- Ethnic identity is socially constructed
	- People create their identities
	- E.g. even racial distinctions are just a matter of custom
		- 'invented traditions': a myth-symbol complex'
		- Creates the 'accepted' history and 'mythicize' real history, taking real events but redefining them as the morally defining experiences of their people.
		- E.g. Serbs in Kosovo
	- How can we tell?
	- A conflict is ethnic only if the sides involved are distinguished primarily on the basis of ethnicity
