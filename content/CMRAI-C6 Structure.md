- This it talking about international structure or domestic structure? (Level of analysis)
- Conflicts can come from antagonistic relationships from **structural problems such as illegitimate institutions**
    - prohibit fair distribution of power and wealth
    - lack ability to correct systemic failure
    - severe oppression

# Structural Conditions for Conflict Resolution

- What is the condition for protracted conflicts to continue?
    - In Ethnic Rivalry, conflict always come from one's group desire to control the destiny of another group For political dominance and economic benefit
        - Suppressed marginalized group's language, customs, religions.
        - Structure affect Autonomy and political independence through educational and economic opportunities
    - Competition over a limited resource causes inter-group clashes that never ends

# System Change and Adjustment

- When mistrust among groups comes from systemic domination and inseucirty felt by the minority group
    - Structural change is essential for constructive accommodation of conflict
    - The powerful party must be convinced: cost of not changing system of alienation is large
- In intractable conflicts the removal of institutional obstacles for participation in self-governance is a key in settling discontent and outraged populations
- Systemic change beyond perceptual modification requires
    - restructuring of social institutions
    - Redistribution of power: between different sectors of society
- Change in relationship of different groups can affect their perception of each other need's legitimacy
    - If social structures put one group in dominate over another, the powerful group won't recognize legitimacy of the weaker group's needs
    - Most times change in relationships isn't enough to stop conflicts, changing the root cause such as reforming the social or security institutions is needed
- Conflicts should be addressed not just for their short-term solution, but the contentious issues that causes many similar conflicts for a conflict-free society.

# The Management of Conflict in Various Social Settings

- Governmental abuse of power can be addressed by **Ombudsmen**
- Pluralistic Democratic Societies: conflict regulation mechanisms: **mediation & arbitration**
- Mandatory mediation for divorces before court
- Tribal societies: informal traditional social practices handle group conflicts with just **intrinsic value of society**
- Traditional **Collectivist view** over individualistic view of justice. Ex: A murderer's family paying the victim's family to not be convicted. (Saudi Arabia)

# Functionalist Perspective

- Functionalists says in the social system, society and organizational functions are part of internal organism of a stable structure and orderly process of social life
    - Actions are consequences of these complex relationships between each part
    - A network of relationships among interacting parts (e.g., politicalâ€“administrative regulatory policies designed to restore confidence of the financial market) can determine the **quality of the systemâ€™s operation**
- Conflicts need to be properly controlled to keep an existing system stable
- In order to constitute a persistent order, the system must perform certain functions
    - the economy should generate enough income for the majority of people in society to meet their basic daily necessities.
    - The equilibrium point of a system can be achieved through proper coordination among it's components: political-administrative, economic, and cultural
    - Government shouldn't regulate the market, but must correct major economic crisis
    - it has become common for political and administrative decisions to get involved in resource allocation

## System Maintenance Functions

- In functionalism: conflcits aren't dysfunctional as long as they maintain the social structure
    - If dysfunctional: relationships need to be regnegotiated to include opposing members of society

# Political Instability and Conflict

- In some political systems, a peaceful process to regulate the clashes between possible winners and losers is not sufficiently developed in redistributing political and economic power.
    - Political instability feeds long-term dictatorship, election, political squabbles, and military coups
        - low level of institutionalization and absence of political culture of compromise, and bargaining

# Response to System Stress

- Coups or election fraud could trigger the society in tension from government oppression
    - System weakness: poverty, ethnic, racial, and religious differences, a weak state capacity to manage tensions, and power inequalities
- Solution: Regular electoral cycle could rebalance power relations between government and the oppressed groups.

# Violence Structure in a Failed State

1. **Complete failure** exemplified by Somalia (with the absence of institutionalized, central political authority).
2. **A semi-failed state** still remaining de jure (e.g., the Democratic Republic of Congo) a semi-failed state maintains different degrees of authority over the population.
3. The existence of a **de facto state** without international legitimacy (e.g, Talian rule).
4. **Transitional state toward failure**â€”by losing its legitimacy
with bad governance, an existing state can degenerate into failure (e.g., Ugandaâ€™s Idi Amin government, the current Mugabe regime)

Characteristics of state collapse

- Fragmentation of political authority: factional divide ruled by quasi-governments
- Opposing militia forces stops any attempts to re-create new state institution
- Abnormal economic transactions extends a protracted conflict in a failed state
- Structural vulnerability to violence: instigated by political tensions and inequality

# Quasi-state

- Some non-state political entity isn't recognized by international community but
    - Control significant territory & population
    - de facto administrative functions: policing and taxation
    - spring from legitimacy crisis of existing states
    
    
    ðŸ’¡ Ex: The north-western part of Sri Lanka, long occupied by Tamil Tiger forces, also established semi-government functions, including taxation, medical service, education and even issuance of passports.
    
    
    

# Linkage Politics

- The internal characteristics of societies prone to be engaged in external wars
    - emergence of aggressive government leaders
    - prominence of a military industrial complex
    - lack of socialization & education promoting peacefulness
- economic attributes of capitalist states at the turn of the past century uncovered crucial linkages between **domestic interests** and **policies abroad**.
- Neo-Liberalist: the external and internal boundaries of a unit can be murky due to interconnected processes within and between the societies that underlie state action
