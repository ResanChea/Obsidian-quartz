writing up your research is the last stage of the process in research project.

it is not a step-by-step process, it requires concise revision of our work that can serve as a benefit for up to improve the work.

going back and forth to edit means, we are filling the gaps in our argument and a reminder for us to take a closer look at our data.

## ACADEMIC WRITING: BUILDING BLOCKS

core components of an IR research essay or thesis are:

- Abstract
- Introduction
- Literature Review
- Methodology
- Data Analysis
- Conclusion
- Bibliography/References

these components serve as a transition when jumping from one detail of idea to another.

## ABSTRACT

**Abstract** is a one-paragraph summary of your research that provides the teaser of a scholarly journey article or dissertation.

- it is a briefing of the whole research, including research question, methodology used in the paper, and key findings.
- for the case of journal abstract, it help identifies the paper's main arguments
- if the abstract is being written prior to the paper, it is important that we go back to check in order to make sure it included all the important features as mentioned above.

## INTRODUCTION

- capture reader's attention of what they are about to read in the paper
	>[!quote]
	>"This project followed a three-tiered approach. First, ... . Second, ... . Third, ... . These three states were selected because they have ... ." [^1]
- SHOULD NOT - try to tell the audience what we aim to achieve or demonstrate in our writing
- SHOULD - contain clear statement as to the topic, why the topic is important, and pinpoint the structure of the paper

## LITERATURE REVIEW

**Literature Review -** provides an organizational and analytical summary of existing scholarly engagement with topic.

- informs reader about the argument raised related to the topic and how those arguments are related to the research question
- provide reader the organizational structure: theoretical, conceptual, analytical or methodological
- the body of the literature will have to reflect those categories and analyze the perspectives, then examine how your research topic is related to the existing scholarly research.

## METHODOLOGY

- it shows the transparency on how we will go to answer the research question
    
    we need to choose what epistemology assumption we select, whether it is empirical explanatory or interpretive discourse analysis
    
- we should describe our own data collection process to the reader
    
    help allow other researchers to trace what you have done in terms of
    
    - data collection (whether quantitative, qualitative, or based on field research)
    - data analysis (qualitative or quantitative), and
- allows for some degree of replicability on the part of other scholars interested in your research results.

## **Methodology for Quantitative Research:**

to provide justification for your methods or models we need to answer serveral questions:

1. How are you using these datasets?
2. Where are they found?
3. Who collected the data?
4. How was it collected?
5. If you are generating your own data through quantitative data collection techniques, such as s**urveys, questionnaires, content analysis**, or some technique to facilitate the coding of documents, you should describe your data collection process to the reader.
6. In the event you have used surveys or questionnaires, you should also specify your **sampling procedures**
    - **random sample** or did you make use of some other form of
    - non-random sampling technique such as **opportunistic or snowball sampling**
- addressing **measurement**
    - **coding or scaling**. You should justify your coding or scaling choices that you made, and what you hoped to demonstrate through this process.

## **DATA ANALYSIS**

- follow the same basic structure for every section within your data analysis so as to allow the reader to more easily follow the logic of your research process, your findings, and your arguments.
- examine our independent variables
- identify purpose of our research for example: process tracing

for data analysis, we need to follow the same basic structure for every section for reader to easily follow the logic of our research process, findings, and arguments like we have three cases of independent variables then each case need to have the same structure to one another to see the real influence to the dependent variable.

## **CONCLUSION**

- demonstrating and justifying your findings in the data analysis section of your essay
- should not include the provision of any new data
- should also avoid introducing new arguments in the conclusion
- provide the reader with your findings in relation to each of your research question or research hypotheses
- Sometimes you may not have a clear-cut response to the question you asked. Do not worry if this is the case
- students of IR should be humble in your findings and not overstate your claims

## **Bibliography**

## WRITING UP YOUR RESEARCH TIPS:

### Step 1

- may have an outline before
- Should have an outline and make it detailed before writing
    - New things you've learned and want changed about your research
    - Unanticipated discoveries
- after writing outline check if your flow have
    - loop holes
    - logic gaps
    - can you respond to questions properly
    - Is your structure readable and easy to understand
    - Restructure and address these concerns

### Step 2

- writing process is a non-linear one as your already have (its not from start to finish)
    - detailed outline of your research
    - you might have started writing parts as well
    - done all the difficult research decisions
- writing takes time:
    - plan for time as writing can be time intensive
    - making multiple drafts
- Audience
    - not writing for lecturers to understand anymore
    - aim at wider contribution to the world and audience

### Writing Stylistic Tips

1. Avoid Passive Voice: 
    - makes cause and relationships in your research harder to understand
    - Example: Bad grade were received in Chemistry
        - Instead say Students received bad grades in Chemistry
2. Avoid Unnecessary Jargon: 
    - Try and simplify concepts as much as possible
    - If unavoidable → provide definition
    - Provide contexts don't assume background knowledge
3. Always write in paragraph forms
    - Topic sentence
    - One single idea
    - Short paragraphs
4. Don't over quote
    - say ideas in your own words and perspective
    - Use if necessary: to not misrepresent the meaning

### Step 3

- write multiple drafts
- Edit your drafts
- Proofread
