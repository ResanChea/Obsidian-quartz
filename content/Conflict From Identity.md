# Conflict From Identity


- **Identity** are ethnicity, tribe, kin, class, caste, gender, and race
    - used as **justification for inequality** in resource allocation and political oppression (Identity Politics)
- Many conflicts come from communal nature of **incompatible perception and expressions** of differences among groups of diverse ethnic and religious affiliations
    - To solve a conflict you must solve the root cause first. And **Identity** is involved in these root causes.

# Identity and Conflict Mobilization

- Identify formation is shaped by the context of **intergroup rivalry**
    - since a strong sense of threat to one‚Äôs central commitments provokes hostilities toward another group.
    - violent protest may be only option for the oppressed group to pursue their interests
- Identity can be become a **direct source of group mobilization**
    - feelings of injustice and relative deprivation derived from the contest.
    - a minority group is treated worse than the majority group
- **Group relations** are embedded in
    - social hierarchies (ethnic and other status)
    - differences in cultural values: recognition of their cultural values
    - economic disparities: equal economic opportunity
    - resource scarcity: equal access to resources as the majority group
    - disagreement on the distribution of power and wealth: socio-economic distribution creates inequality gap between the groups

- In Nepal, urban/rural divisions have constituted class conflict; religious conflict in India was driven by Hindu-Muslim divisions. In Sri Lanka and Moldova, language became a marker of identity.
- A shared fate and the fear of domination by rival group lead to the formation of group consciousness.
- **Differentiated identities are not alone source of violence**, but can lead to a deadly conflict in combination with exclusionary acts of leaders and competition for status, position, or material wealth.
    - violence can start with mobilization and politicization of these socio-economic polarizations

# Polarization of Identities

- Group divisions based on identity differentiation are often related to
    - **radicalization** of conflicts and extreme behavior:
        - manifested in random killings
        - abusive treatment of opposing civilian
        populations
        - as ethnic clensing, genocide, and racial hate crimes
- In a fight against ‚Äúenemy‚Äù groups, identity suddenly becomes a weapon of ethnic cleansing as seen in former Yugoslavia and Rwanda).


üí° Ex: In Croatia during the first President Franjo Tudman era, the vigilance of the ‚Äúenemy within us‚Äù (referring to Serb enclaves) increased the tendency to develop ethnocentrism in combination with authoritarianism.



# Properties & Attributes of Identity

- The deep and foundational forms of collective selfhood can be manifested in the great variety of
    - **distinctive cultural creativities**: ranging from art to drama fo literature to philosophy
- Culture is an inevitable element of group distinctiveness
    - social existence is tied to a particular **language or a religious community** associated with given social practices.
    - people's beliefs can be common identity
- Various types of elites are involved in shaping the content and forms of collective identities in interaction with a broader social environment.
    - shaping political party mobilization, representation, and agendas of each identity
- Identity can be constructed, deconstructed, and reconstructed through the reinterpretation of shared experiences, collective memories and myths in relation to those of others.
    - identity can be constructed for an individual through subconcious means that can **construct/evolve a person's identity to either fit one group or another.**
        
        
        üí° Ex: living environment, social interactions, mentorship, life experiences
        
        
        
- Beyond instrumental forms of social action, identity-based action is linked to not only rational- instrumental incentives but also values, beliefs, tradition, and habit.

# Group Processes of Identity Formation

- **Group boundaries** are determined by issues related to relative power and status, access to resources as well as value differences.
- **Group differences** are associated with socio-economic, class distinctions, occupational groupings, gender, or cultural belongings.
- **The enduring nature of identities** can be explained by the convergence of language, ethnicity, religion, and other group atiributes in the **intensification of we-ness feeling**.
- Identity strengthens cohesiveness with a shared sense of attraction, belongingness, and loyalty to the group.
    - faces the same challenges, have the same loyalties
    - have the same interest and goals
- The psychological features of identity and solidarity
    - are derived from **past sufferings**
    - present or future anxiety about **group well-being and survival**
    - a shared meaning of the Social world.
- A high degree of in-group identification is coupled with an intense level of outside threat which brings forth a basic impulse for self-preservation.
    - think of external-groups are threats to be dealt with through hostilities

# Connection Btw Individual & Group Identity

- In politically divided societies, the self-conception of individual identity is intertwined with and often imposed by **group boundaries** in relation to an **increased motivation**, strengths of attractions toward the group, and the **development of cohesive group norms**.
    - identity groups dividing themselves up, make differences among them larger
- Intra-group differences are de-emphasized to strengthen internal solidarity.
    - making differences in the group smaller for unity
- Group allegiances represent our social connections by defining to ourselves and to others, who we are.

# Formation of Group Boundaries

- The construction of similarity of the members of
any collectivity is geared toward making
distinctions from other groups.
- During an atrocious war or genocide, the notion
of the other is related to the brutal line between
insiders and outsiders in the collective mind.
- In a psychological sense, people‚Äôs realization of
their shared fate increases loyalty to the group.
    - The identification of common attributes reinforces
    the development of collective perceptions of a
    **shared fate** with the attribution of opposing
    features to out-groups.

# Social exclusion and inclusion

- The distinct manifestations of social exclusion and inclusion shape and are shaped by
    - group boundaries (concerning geographical, religious, or ethnic differences, creating transnational) dividing lines
    - after the departure of colonial powers and collapse of multi-ethnic federal states.
    
    
    üí° Ex: Austrian-Hungarian Empire and Ottoman Turkey in the 18th and 19th centuries.
    
    
    
- The principled exclusion of the enemy ‚Äúother‚Äù can be applied to specific settings
    
    
    üí° Ex: (anyone being suspected of being tied to al-Qaeda and the Taliban) by political ideology (such as doctrines of war on terrorism) supported by legislative and institutional mechanisms
    
    
    
- The mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion are related to partitioning people into different social categories and its institutional legitimation.
    
    
    üí° Ex: identity categories in many Latin American societies have evolved out of formation of a group status in a historical process of creating social hierarchies (white, mestizos, natives, and blacks).
    
    
    

# Social Categorization

- The **categorization is likely to rely upon highly visible characteristics** such as gender, ethnicity, or race.
    - Most significantly, social identifications within a group are based on common attitudes and values which aggregate individual differences.
- Distinctive characteristics of groups can be internalized as self-conception, and can be adopted fot socialization.
    - Social categorization is likely to set boundaries for the interpretation of individuals‚Äô actions and beliefs.
    - the association of meaning & identity to individual's actions and beliefs
- The membership of social categories is associated with positive or negative value connotations.
    - Positive in-group identities can be advanced by favorable comparisons with out-groups.
    - uniqueness, similarity, expected bahavior to ensure group's interest & value are pursued
- In evaluating one‚Äôs own group, individuals refer to the attitudes or behavior of another group that functions as the holder of standards for social prestige.
- Morale can be enhanced by **unquestioned loyalty** to a group and call for sacrifice.
    - But: Labelling the enemy without emphathetic consideration can negatively reinforce exaggerated threat ****and blind enemy images in **self-fulfilling prophecies**.
- Identity politics revolve around who controls the process to define communal boundaries.
    - Political entities mobilize resources and people behind **institutionalized symbols**.
    - a sense of unity behind one cause and symbol similar to nationalism

# Cognitive Representation of Identity

- Individuals may construct differing images about their groups and others through a cognitive process.
    - The increased perceptions of distance *in interests, roles, and other
    easily identifiable properties* between in-groups and
    out-groups lead to an emphasis on in-group similarity.
- **demonized views about an adversary**
    - signal hardened identity positions
    - refusal to take any kind of conciliatory move toward amicable solutions to a conflict. (non-negotiable position)
- Even if the **differences are not objectively meaningful**
    - the perceptual act of group categorization in a competitive context can produce discrimination along with the development of stereotypes and bias.
    - self-fulfilling prophecy turning to violence
- Increased hostilities are supported by the rigid
group boundaries in conjunction with negative
patterns of communication confirming biased
perception.
- In fact, stereotypes foster bias-confirming
communication in support of self-fulfilling
prophecies (Gudykunst and Mody, 1989).
- When differences are perceived as threatening to
the identity or well-being of the group, a
competitive context is likely to further widen
psychological distance and biases against
opposing group members.

# The Impact of Social Identification on Inter-group Action

- Ethnocentrism is based on the glorification of in-group properties, and derogation of out-group aspirations and values.
    - Similar to [[Fascism\|Fascism]] thinking one self's identity as superior
    - In-group love is reciprocally connected to out-group rejection and hate.
- This may be **fueled by competitive interactions** based on
    - incompatible interests
    - perceived threat to one‚Äôs goals augments in-group solidarity and heightens out-group hostility
    - supported by a history of antagonism
- In-group glorification helps sustain authoritarian submission as well as ethnocentrism, as is illustrated by [[Nazi-Germany\|Nazi-Germany]] under Hitler.
- The obedience to authority is emphasized in highly cohesive groups often in combination with autocratic leadership which defines and enforces individual conformity with collective norms.
    - to sustain one's power & regime
    - **Negative Impact**: to threaten and deter the out-groups

# Bridging in-group and out-group differences

- The exaggeration of between-group **differences can be minimized**
    - by stressing the uniqueness of individual out-group members
    - by equating them as part of a larger human community.
- In addition, the inclusiveness of group boundaries can be expanded by the **transfer of in-group favoritism to out-groups**.
- **Positive inter-group relations** are facilitated by the improvement in attitudes and behavior toward out-group members.
    - cultural exchange, sharing of ideas
- Extended interaction between group members emerges from **functional cooperation** which will eventually lead to the development of common goals. [[Functionalism\|Functionalism]]
- Increased contact can develop benevolent effects only if groups have equal status to avoid one party‚Äôs domination.
- New information gained through personalized interaction
helps replace existing categories which form the basis of
classifying each other.
- In the long run, the inter-group contact is expected to produce a change in the attitude toward a group beyond immediate individual encounters.
- As groups cooperatively work to develop a common goal, inter-group bias can decrease along with an increased contact supported by institutional or social forces.
- The recognition of inter-group similarities and common
interests helps members of both groups acknowledge the
strengths of the other group as well as their own for
improved inter-group relations.
- Out-group bias and discrimination can be minimized
by cross-cutting social categories among multi-group
membership.
- The patterns of conflict regulation can be socially
institutionalized by the development of cross-cutting
ties which promote cooperation among multiple
functions and roles of various groups.
- The coexistence of diverse cultures has been effective
if promoting tribal ties. Furthermore, joint economic
and social activities among the youth and women
have been promoted in developing cross-cutting ties
in the peace-making process.
- In general, the recognition of the necessity for
cooperation and common bonds can emerge from
the development of superordinate goals.

# De-categorization

- Qualitative change in the core sense of self may come from de-categorization and re-categorization.
- Through de-categorization, group boundaries can be
redefined in the manner that opposing group
members are encouraged to recognize similarities and
differences on an individual basis.
- De-categorization refers to a process of reducing the
salience of ingroup-outgroup distinctions. An important consequence is that negative behaviors
- Associated with ingroup‚Äîoutgroup distinctions, such as
prejudice, ssereatyping. and intergroup discrimination,
are also diminished.
- The personalization of out-group members helps de-
activate the undesirable images of an out-group in
reducing group hostilities.

# Re-categorization

- Re-categorization redefines group categorization at a
higher level of inclusiveness without diminishing or abolishing
existing social categories.
- Re-categorization can be achieved by identification with a
single superordinate identity with reduced salience of sub-
group identities, or by the development of a dual identity in
which both superordinate and sub-group identities are
granted legitimate.
- Re-categorization can be achieved by a shift in the main
basis of group differentiation to a new superordinate
ategory which embraces all different racial groups.
- In curbing ethno-nationalism in multinational states,
supranational identity can be promoted in conjunction with
power sharing and other political or social arrangements
which grant a unique role to minority groups.


üí° Ex: People in Quebec have the dual identities of being a Canadian and French-speaking national group.



# From De-categorization to re-categorization

- The commitment to a new superordinate national
identity decreases the salience of disparate group boundaries so that they can become less obvious to insiders and outsiders.
- In post-conflict reconciliation, the process of apology and forgiveness is part of the rituals to r√©discover each other's humanities as a shared.
dentity base.
    - apologies given to victims and enemies to rebuild trust
    - for future collaboration
- The emphasis on shared humanity permits
individuals to be seen as either victims (whose
dignity should be restored) or perpetrators (who
are responsible for their own acts).
