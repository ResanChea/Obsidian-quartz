	- Needs to be structured to be analyzed
- Quantitative Data
	- Nominal Data: data which only have names and no ordering value of higher or lower
	- Ordinal Data: data which is rankable and comparable to other values
	- Interval Data: data that changes at a consistent interval value (temperature, 10-point scale)
	- Numerical/Ratio Data: Decimal values such as scores, salary, price...
- Why is it necessary to understand different types of data?
