# Interdependence Liberalism

- **Interdependence Liberalism**: interdependent countries rarely voluntarily get in conflict with one another. [^1]
    - **welfare** is the primary concern for states
        - Need qualified labor force, access to information, financial capital [^2]
    - **military power** more and more irrelevant, powerful states grow with trade, not invasion anymore [^1]
        - Don't need to have territory, military, natural resources [^2]

## Division of Market Specialization [^2]

separate actors **specializing themselves in what they're good** at and trading with produce which they're not good at producing

- **It discourage conflicts as states rely on one another**: interdependence makes cooperation more valuable
- **Less likely to use military to solve conflicts**: trade agreements and reliance on supply chain makes it a bad decision to go to war
- Less Developed Countries are more likely to use military to solve conflicts than richer ones

## 1.  [[Functionalism\|Functionalism]] Theory [^2]

- **Peace**: greater transnational ties could lead to peace
    - Technical Experts, not politicians, should manage cooperation, find solutions to solve them rationally instead of ideologically

## 2. [[Neo-Functionalism\|Neo-Functionalism]] Theory [^2]

- **Improve Cooperation**: Politicians ****should lead cooperation by shifting their interests to states with similar interests
    - **Spillover**: increased cooperation in one area will lead to increase in cooperation in surrounding area.

## 3. Post-war complex interdependence [^2]


ðŸ’¡ **High-politics**: the state interests of survival, balance of power, and self interests

**Low-politics**: the states focus on matters less important than survival of state



Low-Politics is more important than High-Politics

In a world where **war is not an option for states anymore** because of complex interdependence (from globalization, commercialization, supply chain). 

### Implications

1. States pursue separate goals from their transnational actors
2. Power Resources impacts regionally

IGO's importance will increase: 

- weak states need platform to raise their voice
- Coalitions formations
- IOs will set international agendas
