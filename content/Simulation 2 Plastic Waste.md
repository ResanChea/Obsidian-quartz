Myanmar generates nearly the 9th lowest amount of municipal solid waste at 0.84 million tons per
year in ASEAN[3]. Despite the low amount, the Government of Myanmar approved the National
Waste Management Strategy and Action Plan for Myanmar 2017-2030 in 2018, which sets out the
strategy based on principles of inclusiveness, zero waste, zero emissions to achieve a greener,
cleaner and healthier environment in the country[6]. The government has implemented the action
plan to contribute to the three pillars (environmental, economic and social matters) for sustainable
development

- Myanmar has the lowest per capital Municiple Solid Waste generated

There is a rapid increase in waste generation in some cities in Myanmar[8]. The three major cities of Yangon, Mandalay and Naypyitaw generated approximately 55 percent of total solid waste in the country in 2016. 

Due to

- Rapid Industrializaiton
- Urbanization

The waste was composed mainly of organic materials (77%), while the remainder comprises plastic (13%), paper (7%) and others (3%)

## Current Waste Management

- Mainly waste collection and disposal
- Minimal recycling: policies were developed by the government in 2009, but there is no plan or project to implement them yet

- Temporary Disposal: a waste dump where workers sort through by hand to separate paper, plastic, metal, and plastic bottles, sent back to the city to resell and recycle
- Final Disposal: a dump for unsorted waste

**City Development Committee and Township Development Committee** in each respective city and township is responsible for waste management in its own territory to finance, plan, and deliver urban services related to waste management

Its roles and responsibilities are to 

- collect waste systematically
- provide appropriate waste bins
- collect payment

There were a total of 4,220 workers employed in the Yangon City Development Committee, while there were 2,000 workers in the Mandalay City Development Committee for waste collection and disposal in 2015

The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation is also a focal ministry for overall environmental management in Myanmar, including solid waste management. 

• Environmental Conservation Law (2012)
• Environmental Conservation Rules (2014)
• Environmental Impact Assessment Procedures (2015)
• National Environmental Quality (Emission) Guidelines(2015)
• Draft Order on Types of Hazardous Wastes

The Environmental Conservation Department plays a key role in promulgating laws, policies and a strategic action plan in cooperation with development committees related to solid waste management, and organize conferences, workshops, and training for raising public awareness on solid waste

After Vice President U Myint Swe expressed concern at the September (2018) environmental conservation committee meeting, the nation took note to invest in new technologies, including internal recycling centers and even electronic recycling opportunities.

- using the 3 R’s of waste management: reduce, reuse, and recycle.
- New leading edge in waste management
- New practices for renewable sources

The nation also leads the way in food and plastic recycling in ASEAN

Myanmar has taken actions against environmental issues by passing many regulations these past few decades. 

For reference:

- National Environment Policy (1994)
- Myanmar Agenda 21 (1997)
- National Sustainable Development Strategy –NSDS (2009)
- Environmental Conservation Law (2012)
- Environmental Conservation Rules (2014)
- Environmental Impact Assessment Procedure (2015)
- National Environmental Quality (Emission) Guidelines (2015)

The government of Myanmar has ratified the Basel Convention in January and implemented it in April 2015. In 2018, Myanmar approved the the National Waste Management Strategy and Master Plan , spanning from 2018 to 2030, with the end goal of a zero waste and inclusive waste management system for a sustainable and brighter environmental future. Our nation has been following the three R's of Sustainable Waste Management: reduce, reuse, and recycle.

Myanmar Recycling: 

In case of recycled waste in Yangon city, 86 TPD out of 1,690 TPD could be recycled, which is only
5% of the total waste. Among the recycled waste, glasses are mostly recycled and cardboard and
paper are the second highest recycled items.

- Define types of wastes:
    - Municipal Solid Waste: daily nonhazardous waste that spreads but isn't toxic.
    - Hazardous Waste/Industrial Waste: cafeteria garbage, dirt & gravel, oil... no decomposable
    - E-waste/Emerging Waste Streams: Plastic, health, and toxic components
- Reduce Plastic Use?
    
    How?
    
    What is the alternative?
    
    People rely on benefits of plastic, how to convince?
    
- The issue of Organic Waste
    - Is the majority in waste of many ASEAN countries
    - dumpsites: creates methane (bad for atmosphere)

the basel convention (1989) only covered hazardous waste

- All 10 ASEAN signed, but only Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia extended to plastic restriction aswell
- Myanmar signed earlier convention

# 1- Plastic Waste trade influx

China ban solid waste import in early 2018

- ASEAN region increase in plastic waste by 171%
- Mislabeled 'recyclable' imported waste that is non-recyclable
- Illegal imports

Unilateral bans only move problems of illegal importers to other unrestricted areas

- Need to focus on the sources of plastic: single use plastic & packaging
- Find alternatives for plastic. Stop producing single use plastic
- Invest in recycle technologies

# 2- Transboundary plastic waste management

- Phillipines:
    - Not too drastic change, non recyclable plastic first. Other are not as beneficial and expensive, affect the ecocnomy so much
