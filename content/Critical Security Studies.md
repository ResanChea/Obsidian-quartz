- **Security studies** is a sub-discipline of IR that studies the origin of war and it's conducts that focuses on **threats to a nation's safety**
    - What are considered threats? Is it only the state we need to secure?
        - Not exclusively limited to use of force
        - Pandemics
        - Environmental degrade
        - [[Terrorism\|Terrorism]]
        - Interstate armed conflicts (is a sub-field of strategic studies itself)
- Modern security theorists rejecting traditional thought of state in war as most important
    - Wideners: Modern theorists who broadened the scope to more non-traditional security
    - No agreement on what security actually is
- What is dividing them?
    - Security is inherently undefinable
    - Security can come from many different theoretical directions
        - Turned into subjective definition based on persons

### Copenhagen School

- Security is about survival (similar to realism)
    - But a threat is only an issue when it threatens the existence of the nation
- Secularization: when an actor claims something is a threat to the existence of the victim thing
    - Normally the actor is a government authority: who is a self-referencing actor of what is a threat
    - Authority must present the threat and be accepted by the reference audience to be a threat
        - To be able to declare a state of emergency, the authority must mobilize force and support for taking drastic actions
    - Does Copenhagen school disagree with this?

### Wealth Abilitries School

- Criticize state-centric nature of security study
    - Called emancipation school because it adds to the traditional idea of security
        - Sovereign state is the main cause of insecurity instead of the source of security
        - More people are killed by their own government than other countries

### Paris School

- Focus on interpretation the language use in the security discourse
    - To find truth about how we feel secure or insecure

### Aberystwyth

- First world is the western world the democracies
- Second world is the eastern bloc, russia, china, vietnam, communism...
- Third World is the neutral non-alligned countries (Banhdong conference, Non-Aligned Movement)
    - Misunderstood as the poor and undeveloped countries

# Contribution to IR

Critical Security Studies is a focus on something other than states and formal actors such as the [[United Nations\|United Nations]]. Critical Security Studies has encouraged us to think more seriously about things that affect **individuals**, particularly from **unprivileged groups**

- broadened the importance of non-traditional international actors
- its not only states who can cause effects in the international level, non-state actors can and is important too
