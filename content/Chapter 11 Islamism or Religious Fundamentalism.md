# Overview

- Islamism believes in constructions of the 'Islamic state', divine truths of the **Islam law, Sharia** must be used as a guideline.
- Islamism is characterized by
    - The revolt against the West
    - What it stands for with Islamic beliefs
    - Association with **militancy and violence**
        - The notion of Jihad (holy war): all Muslims are obliged to support global Jihadism
- Islamism Has many variations between moderate and conservative

# Origin of Islamism

- Religion is getting more connected with Politics
    - Backlash by **The Secularization Thesis**: encouraging separation of religion and politics
    - Ex: [[Iran Islamic Revolution (1979)\|Iran Islamic Revolution (1979)]]
    - 1980s â†’ Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Judaism all started connecting religion and politics as well
- Why is Religion and Politics more connected?:
    - **Identity Politics**: modern society is more **disconnected, diffused, individualized** needing religion to unify them with the **same values, world view, morals** as a divine source of knowledge
- This link between Religion and Politics in Islam creates **Islamism|Political Islam**: a political creed or a commitment to the establishment of an Islamic state based on the sharia

## Islam Thinking Timeline

- 1800s: Surge In response to **colonialism** bad social and political condition (Ex: Deobandi sect in Sunni Hanafi Islam & [[Taliban\|Taliban]] )
    - Rapid urbanization
    - Dislocation of traditional communities and crafts
    - Growing unemployment
    - Anomie: societal alienation and separation
- 1900s: **The Muslim Brotherhood** a model of political, and sometimes militant, activism combined with Islamic charitable works that has subsequently been embraced across the Muslim world.
- Post [[World War 2\|World War 2]]: made Islamism a power political force because
    - End of colonialism replaced with **Neo-imperialism** (US) in the Middle-East
    - **Arab-Israeli** **conflict** disperse refugees creating opportunity for religiously-based politics
    - **1973 oil crisis** made middle-east oil states influential spreading fundamentalist Islam
    - **Afghan-Soviet War** created Mujahideen, [[Al-Qaeda\|Al-Qaeda]], and War on terror
    - **US invasion of [[Iraq\|Iraq]]** created conflicts between Muslims â†’ creation of [[ISIS\|ISIS]]

# Core Themes: religion as ideology

- Enlightenment â†’ secularism: religion separated/replacing ideology
    - Ideology gives **salvation** of economic and social well-being while religion gives salvation of after-life or reincarnation
    - Both gives people a **sense of purpose** for existing
    - Ideology also use **ceremonies** to strengthen their sense of commitment and beliefs.
- Islamism is the transformation of religion into ideology with these themes:
    - fundamentalism and modernity
    - Islamism and Islam
    - revolt against the West
    - the Islamic state
    - jihadism

## 1. Fundamentalism and modernity

Islamism takes on '**religious fundamentalism**' meaning common fundamental knowledges are from interpretations of sacred texts from Islam.


ðŸ’¡ fundamentalism refers to a commitment to certain ideas and values from religions that are seen as

- â€˜basic & foundationalâ€™
- unchallenged & overriding authorities in all thinking
- enduring and unchanging character
- linked to belief system's supposedly original or classical forms

Usually linked with **religious texts** (Bible, Sharia, Quran) or even political creeds

> "Religion is the only source of truth"
> 


- Islamism is a way of life covering not just faith but society, politics, and relations

### Islamism adopting modernist ideas

- Islamism relies on both activist and dynamic **(modern) interpretations of sacred text** as well as faith in **inherited structures and traditions**.
    - doesn't believe in mysticism or dwell on past glories
    - willing to accept western ideas (internet, tech devices, Islamic science and economics of [[Economic Liberalism\|Economic Liberalism]])

Example of a modernist Islamic state is [[Iran\|Iran]]

## 2. Relations between Islamism $\leftrightarrows$ Islam

- Islam is faith, it does imply political values but doesn't endorse a particular form of government
- Islamism is an ideology with political agenda of focus on state order


ðŸ’¡ A Critique of Islamism

- Islamism is an inauthentic distortion of true Islam
- It's linked with totalitarian, antisemitism, incompatible with democracy, prone to violence


2 Groups thinks Islamism and Islam is **linked**

- Islamist says Islam and Islamism is linked Islamism's concern is to revive the true religion of Islam
- Proponents of the '**clash of civilizations**' thinks Islamism has its roots in Islam which already prescribed ways of life, society, and structure already totalitarian making both anti-pluralism in accepting non-Islamic ideas

It's hard to distinguish between moderate and extreme Islamism because one is just worse than the bad

# Revolt Against the West

> Islamism developed not through isolation from the West but through encounters with
the West
> 

Islamism is similar to communism and fascism in that it opposed the failing Liberal thinking after WW1 in making a new society devoid of corruption and immorality thats never changing.

Islam being confronted with two possible relations with the rest of the world: â€˜peace with a contractual agreement, or warâ€™

- Which is taken to adoption by ISIS and Al-Qaeda
- US and the West has fostered a neo-imperialism agenda to be the hegemon
    - control the oil by supporting Israel
    - invading Afghanistan and Iraq for military intervension for power and control
    - Foster a 'Islamophobia' among the world that all muslims are exteremists
-
