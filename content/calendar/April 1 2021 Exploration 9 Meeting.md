Should careless students be removed?

- absents
- no progress update

Meet face to face with student to ask them about their lackings and inform them about dropping students 

Look at buddy team member 

- See if they are putting in efforts and not getting results
- Or if they aren't putting in much efforts unless we ask them for results

Have b Bill join one session to inform and reaffirm that

- We facilitators are doing this for free and they should respect our time and effort
