# Quantitative Approach
- Quantitative [[Research\|Research]] is the use of numbers and data to prove arguments.
	- In political science: data is collected using *Observational Data* instead of *Lab data* since countries and people can't be control-grouped.
### Research Variable
- represent amounts of things (e.g. the number of trees in a forest). Types of quantitative variables include:
	- Ratio Variables: represent measures and can usually be divided into units smaller than one (e.g. 0.75 grams).
	- Integer Variables: represent counts and usually canâ€™t be divided into units smaller than one (e.g. 1 tree).
- In [[political science\|political science]], the most reliable data are collected by governments annually (GDP, Immigration, Birth Rates)
	- Researchers, individuals, agencies can only survey a small sample of population
