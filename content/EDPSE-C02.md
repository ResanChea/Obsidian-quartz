# EDPSE-C02:

- The World Bankâ€™s classification of countries

These features in common are *on average and with great diversity*, in comparison with developed countries:

- Lower levels of living and productivity
- Lower levels of human capital
- Higher levels of inequality and absolute poverty
- Higher population growth rates
- Greater social fractionalization
    - Religious fighting
    - Ethnic fighting
    - Resource Curse makes civil conflicts
- Larger rural population - rapid migration to cities: urbanization
- Lower levels of industrialization and manufactured exports
    - Main industry is agriculture
    - GDP is from export of raw material
- Adverse geography: weather not fit for health or agriculture
- Underdeveloped financial and other markets
- Colonial Legacies - poor institutions etc.
    - Institutional structure left by colonial masters
    - burdening people instead of helping society
    
    
    ðŸ’¡ Ex: French collecting tax from its colonies and poor families
    
    
    

# **Holistic Measures of Living Levels and Capabilities**

- HDI is a holistic measure of living level
    - Health
    - Life expectancy
    - Education

$$
\text{HDI}= 
\frac{\text{income index}}{3} + 
\frac{\text{life expectancy index}}{3} + 
\frac{\text{education index}}{3}

### 2. Common characteristic of developing country

- Lower levels of living and productivity
- Lower levels of human capital (poor human development/resources such as technical skills and expertise like scientist and technician, abundance labor)
- Higher levels of inequality and absolute poverty (poor accessibility, long working hours, low salary)
- Higher population growth rates (related to economic, social factors)
- Greater social fractionalization
    - Religious fighting (fighting over status)
    - Ethnic fighting
    - Resource Curse
- Larger rural population - rapid migration to cities (less population at rural)
- Lower levels of industrialization and manufactured exports (GDP is agricultural based, GDP based on raw material or textile export, not abundance manufactured export)
- Adverse geography (lands are not fertile, land lock countries- no access to the sea â†’ does not have economic benefits such as port, sea route advantage)
- Underdeveloped financial and other markets (government have too much power over the markets, working under bad condition and workers arent treated properly as rule of law, monopoly)
- Colonial Legacies - installed poor/exploited institutions etc. (corrupted system, bad tax system especially in European country such as in Africa where tax is causing a burden to the people by the Germans and France)
    - Ex: even after the leave of a colonizer, the independent state would still often uses the old tax system that is corrupted.
    - Tax should be bring benefits to the country (investment in education, health care, security)
    - While Tax system inherit from previous colonizer still remain corrupted (too much power hold by 1 individual in this system)

### 2.2. Basic indicators of development: Real income, health, and education

- **Gross National Income (GNI):** is ****a hideous oversimplification of this is that itâ€™s â€˜Gross Domestic Product + the additional income that self-employed people pay themselves +incomeÂ received from abroadâ€™.
- **Gross Domestic Product (GDP):** is the total economic value of goods and services (expressed in US dollars) produced within the borders of a country in the course of a year and available for consumption in the market place.
- **Gross National Product (GNP)**Â is the same but includes the value of all services produced at home and abroad.Â *A country such as Ghana will have a relatively similar GDP to GNP because it doesnâ€™t have many companies which produce things abroad: most production takes place within Ghana. America, on the other hand, which is where many Transnational Corporations are based, has a much higher GNP than GDP â€“ Think about MacDonaldâ€™s for example â€“all of those Big Macs sold outside of the USA wonâ€™t appear in the GDP of the USA but will appear in the GNP.*
- ****Gross National Income Per Capita (PPP):**** Gross National Income Per CapitaÂ â€“ is GNI divided by the population of a country, so itâ€™s GNI per person.

### 2.3. Holistic measures of living levels and capabilities

$\text{HDI}= \frac{\text{income index}}{3} + \frac{\text{life expectancy index}}{3} + \frac{\text{education index}}{3}$

## New HDI

$$New\ HDI=\sqrt[3]{H}\sqrt[3]{I}\sqrt[3]{E}$$

## Convergence
- Technological tranfer
	- Leapfrogging in technology
- Spillover
