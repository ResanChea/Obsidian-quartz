# What is constitution?

Constitution is a set of fundamental laws that determines the shape and form of the political structure.

It defines the central institutions and offices, and powers and duties of the state.

It attempts to create Checks and Balances: balance power between [[governmental branches\|governmental branches]] (no small group can have too much power)

# Why do we need constitution?

We need to have it because constitutions are also the rules of the political game

- who can vote
- who can stand for office
- what powers they are to have
- the rights and duties of citizens and so on.

Without these basic rules politics would degenerate into 

- arbitrariness
- brute force
- anarchy.

If the rules work well, we tend to take them for granted and concentrate on the day-to-day game of politics, just as we take the rules of our favorite sport for granted and concentrate on today’s match. 

Nonetheless, constitutions are important because they have a profound influence over how the game of politics is played, and therefore over the outcome of the game – who gets what, and when? 

# What are the 4 main features of constitutions?

Fundamental Laws: is meta-rules "The rule to make rules"
