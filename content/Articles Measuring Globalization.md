# Internationalization

a country might record a high ‘globalization’ score when its international transactions are in fact heavily concentrated with neighbouring countries.

# Indices

- it is impossible to include them all individually in one regression. Therefore, the study develops an index of globalization covering its most important aspects:
    - economic integration
    - social integration
    - political integration

## Limitations of Indices

- Indices/ranking in measuring globalization have limitations of:
    - Indices cannot accurately establish or explain long term trends
    - Most indices focus on economic globalization and not cultural globalization. Economic globalization is still uncertain how accurate it represent globalization
    - Sub-Indices: are still merged into a unified index without any attempt at either distinguishing between globalization breadth and depth, or, still less, at revealing the complex interaction between the various aspects of globalization
    - Indices capture the volume of flow (economic, migration, informational, etc.) but not their direction (country → country flow)
        - does not allow any distinction between globalization and regionalization.

# Why does measuring globalization matter?

- we are hardly capable of constructing and verifying any formal explanations and hypotheses regarding
    - the complexity of globalization **processes**
    - their **interrelation and mutual influence** from globalization
    - and still less – of either developing mathematical models describing globalization, or making **reliable forecasts** on the future globalization

# Need a multidimensional methodology for globalization measurement

- **network analysis** seems the most suitable tool for analyzing globalization processes through
    - capturing the country-to-country flows: how broad has globalization spread?
    - their direction, content, and dynamics: its flow, depth, and trends
    - revealing the key nodes in the network of the globalized world: which parts are important points influencing globalization
- **analysis with global city studies**: reveal the various extent to which different regions within each single country are permeated by globalization and involved in the globalized world
