- Was APT the product of 97 Asian Financial Crisis? Why?
- Why did US oppose the establishment of APT? Why did it come into existence?
    1. APT was established amid the Asian Financial Crisis, a factor for the US reluctance. The US and IMF turned their back to the East Asia based on the opposition to the idea of AMF. This was viewed as the US concentrated on promoting Anglo-American style capitalism than solving the crisis which led to the distrust of East Asian on the two and the unsupported of American joining APT.
    2. there was no invitation for the US from Prime Minister Mahathir. The US demolished the proposal of EAEC clearly expressed the hesitation of the US in joining initiatives. It is rationally can be seen that Mahathir has no interests in inviting the US.
    3. there is no opposition from the US on the development of APT. Secretary of State James Kelly considered APT as an interesting development and healthy development kind of dialogue within East Asia. The reason is because APT does not based on clear agenda but only with tentative path toward institutionalization which is harmless to the US interests.
