- [[US\|US]] almost destroyed Cuba
    - Kennedy responded to the ‘soft message’ by empathizing with Soviet:

- Belief and seeing is often wrong
    - US assuming from 1 attack and 1 misinterpreted attack as an escalation of the Vietnamese
    - And believed that they would not stop until they win
- A fuck ton of Bombings started
- In the Vietnam War: US didn’t empathize with the Vietnamese
    - US thought of Vietnam as a proxy of Cold War: this political objective doesn’t fit the 3 trinity of war.
        - People don’t care about Vietnamese’s independence
    - Vietnamese thought of it as a Civil War: they fought for independence against slavery
        - Vietnamese know they aren’t pawns of Chinese or Soviet: therefore they would’ve never stopped fighting a war for survival
            - Alliance with China was only because of convenience and not of ideology
        - [[Strategic Realism\|Strategic Realism]] [[Theoretical Perspectives on Game Theory\|Theoretical Perspectives on Game Theory]]
- Sometimes you can’t figure out the political objective of the enemy
