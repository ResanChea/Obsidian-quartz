# [[Classical Realism\|Classical Realism]]: Scholarly Perspectives

# [[Thucydides\|Thucydides]]

**States**

- ...naturally are not equal, they uses power to dominate others and defend themselves
- ...must adapt to their situation to survive

**Rulers**' decisions are impactful and must be careful what they do about foreign policy

- Foresight: to anticipate and predict what will happen, see which is the best option in making decisions
- Prudence: Must be careful so they would avoid the risk
- Caution:??
- Judgement:??

**Justice**

- ...is about the level of power, is useless, the more power you have the more justified you are
- ...is about recognizing your strengths and weaknesses and adapting to the unequal situation

### The Thucydides' Trap

> If a rising power is rising, another dominant power will try to resist them from rising. Leading to the trap of war between two major powers.
> 

Ex: U.S. and China have been challenging one another as China has been quickly growing. (Trade War ⇒ future physical conflict)

# [[Niccolò Machiavelli\|Niccolò Machiavelli]]

focus on survival and security

The power (lion) and deception (fox) are the two essential means for survival in conduction of foreign policy

- Need of power: to defend one self
- Must be aware and anticipate actions of others
    - Preemptive War: to attack a potential enemy even during time of peace.

> "A leader must focus on both power and perception to be able to survive. challenges come in all shapes and sizes, picking one over another is not enough."
> 

**Private Morality** in foreign relations will threaten the state's security and survival

- Bringing good faith of a leader as the reason for the state's actions

> "A leader should not let his good control him. Rather allow himself to flex between good or evil according to the state's necessity"
> 

# [[Thomas Hobbes\|Thomas Hobbes]]

The state of nature / uncivilized nature is always in the 'state of every man for himself'

Civilization / Sovereignty States are created to deal with internal and external disorder or threats.

### **Problem of Security Dilemma**

❌ threat between individuals 

States build up security ⇒ others build up security also ⇒ less secure in than first place

state of nature on the international level

- Need of power: to defend one self
- Need of deception: take opportunity to strengthen one self

**Private Morality** in foreign relations will threaten the state's security and survival

**Public Morality** must be practiced to lead a country successfully

- Put security and survival of society and state first, not morality.

✔ threat between states

# [[Hans Morgenthau\|Hans Morgenthau]]

6 principles

- Politics has the nature of self-centered, self regarding first.
- 'an autonomous sphere to action' cannot be conducted using morals. You have the freedom to do anything without the care of other's well beings
- Interests are ever changing, and realism is the set of beliefs to respond to the changing political reality
- The ethic of dealing with international relations is to decide what is best for the people (security & welfares)
- Nations imposing their ideologies on other nations could backfire and threaten the crusading country.
- Statecraft must be conducted knowing the flaws of human nature and not what they could be
