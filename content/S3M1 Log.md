### Comments from Lecturer

- This time was better as there were no deadlock or awkward silence with procedures
- What to focus on June 29, 2021
    - we focused on what we should do, but didn't mention why we should do that instead of other methods
    - Issue of intellectual property is important to be contested for against transfer of vaccine technology to poor countries
- Should find arguments from academic journal instead of opinion pieces from news articles
    - Should intellectual property be shared or not
- Focus on the broader arguments and solutions instead of wording errors and interpretation of a clause for 3rd week
- Focus on rejecting or supporting one argument or another with good examples and evidence
