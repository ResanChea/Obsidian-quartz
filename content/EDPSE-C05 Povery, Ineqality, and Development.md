# Measuring Ineqality and Povery

## Measuring Absolute Povery
- Headcount Index: H/N
	- H is the number of persons who are poor
	- N is the total number of people in the economy
- Total povery gap

- Average Poverty Gap: $APG	 = \frac{TPG}{N}$
	- Normalized Poverty Gap (NPG): $NPG = \frac{APG}{Y_P}$
- Average Income Shortfall (AIS): $AIS=\frac{TPG}{H}$
	- Normalized Income Shortfall $NIS=\frac{AIS}{Y_P}$
- The Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (FGT) index:
$$
P_\alpha=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^H(\frac{Y_P-Y_i}{Y_P})^\alpha
$$
- N: number of persons
- H: number of poor persons
