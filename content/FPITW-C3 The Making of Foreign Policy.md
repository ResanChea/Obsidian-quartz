# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. What is Foreign Policy Making

- **Foreign Policy Making** (FPM) is the process by which the government analyse existing problems, evaluate policy alternatives, and take appropriate actions to solve the important issues and maximize national interest.


ðŸ’¡ Five frameworks for the making of FP

1. **Four broader steps**: (1) identifying the problem, (2) searching for alternatives, (3) choosing an alternative, and (4) executing or implementing the alternative.
2. **Six steps of FPDM**: (1) framing, (2) agenda setting, (3) options, (4) decision, (5) Implementation, and (6) Evaluation within individual, governmental and social scale.
3. **11 steps of FPDM**: (1) Goal setting, (2) information gathering/intelligence, (3) option formulation, (4) option planning, (5) option programing, (6) decision making, (7) implementation, (8) monitoring, (9) appraisal, (10) modification, (11) memory storage and recall (achieve)
4. There are **five types of FPDM** based on the situation the FP is made: (1) one-shot decisions (single decision in a particular single case), (2) interactive decisions (decision made by at least two actors), (3) sequential decisions (a series of interrelated decisions), (4) sequential-interactive decisions (similar to 3 and involved by at least two actors), and (5) group decisions.
5. Another way to classify **FPDM is based on the issues**: **macro** (about regional and international) issues, **micro** (domestic or administrative) issues, and **crisis** (urgent/unexpected) decisions.

- Policy making is important for many fields, especially important FP making
- FP making has problem of
    - **Level of Analysis**: whether to scope int', national, local, individual... etc
    - FP isn't as important as the decision in the first place. Sometimes **policy makers have no choice** but to follow decisions made by one or a small group initially.
    - Reliable analysis of foreign policy requires the **acquisition of information to test hypotheses and reach conclusions**
        - closed countries: hard to get your hand on in some cases
        - too much information makes contention of what is reality
        - unreliable or fragmented information

# 2. Three different images of FP making

- Historical case analysis for FP making is inefficient and doesn't apply in many cases
- Generalization using analytical frameworks/models/images is the way

## 2.1. Rational Actor Image

- The approaches that retain an assumption of rationality.
- **1st approach: [[Realism\|Realism]] view**
    - human preoccupation with power results in a competitive international system.
- **2nd approach: [[Structural Realism\|Structural Realism]]**
    - Neo-Realist perspective places an emphasis on the structural features of the international system, in particular, its anarchic nature.
    - International politics is reflective of self-help actions in the distribution of power
- **3rd approach: [[Rational Choice Theory\|Rational Choice Theory]]**
    - It accepts that policy makers operate under constraints of time, knowledge and place.
- The considerations of rationality that are central to the different accounts are supported by three arguments.
    - Policy makers themselves often claim to be acting in a rational manner.
    - It considers the distinctive nature of foreign policy.
    - Iterates to the seeming simplicity and analytical elegance of the idea of rationality itself.
- Yet, the rationality assumption has not been without its detractors, certain problems, which are the terminological, and the general point relates to the nature of the policy-making unit.

## 2.2. Images of 'Political' Foreign Policy Making

- Political and bureaucratic elites have a great influence over the FMP through political activities.
    - bargaining process on whether a policy should be accepted
- **Bureaucratic politics model**: created to better understand the political policy process
    - the view FP makers try to promote is influenced by their bureaucratic positions
        - fill the gap for
        - Explain FP making by focusing on government instead of its context/environment
- Policy makers often involved in **Two-Level Game theory**
    - To balance the benefits between the domestic and international level groups
        - calculate cost/benefits
        - negotiate with international and domestic actorszz
    - Policy makers, when making policies, have to cope with demands of their political system and external demands as well.
    - favour domestic groups or the international level, or find a mutually beneficial solution

## 2.3. 'Psychological' Images

- Assumption: Personal characteristic of policy leaders will have a determining impact on the nature of policy
    - perception of the policy sometimes differs from the reality: FP makers can only imagine their ideal â€˜subjectiveâ€™ world and hope it translate to the favorable â€˜objectiveâ€™ world of reality.
    - Cognitive biases, perceptual distortion due to uncertainty and complexity
        - They fall back on personal core beliefs
- There are 2 possible methods in examine FPM:
    - Moving between different images depends on the circumstances of FPM under critical observation.
    - Involving with simultaneously elements of more than one type of image of FPM.

ðŸ’¡ No image is better than the other, they are used depends on the context or circumstances



# 3. FP making in the context of the transformed world

- The world is always changing and so does the world politics.
- Therefore, the student of foreign policy and policy makers themselves have to be more responsive to a fluid, more complex agenda and an increasing diversity of actors upon the world stage.
- To analyze FPM in this environment, we need to look back to the three sets of images that influence FPM:

## 3.1. **Rational actor images**

- [[Kenneth Waltz\|Kenneth Waltz]]: dismisses changes in the international system as it's still anarchic
    - FP making are unchanged
    - Objective is still survival and security

## 3.2. **Images of political foreign policy making**

- this set of images make a link between changing nature of foreign policy and political processes on three separate grounds:
    - Increased complexity of international events required adaptation in FPM
        - new institutions, processes, methods to adapt to
    - Complexity has increased the domestic political significance of foreign policy
    - Multiple channels of contact among societies
        - intergovernmental channel: ex: EU, they still need to pay more attention to multinational channel
        - Ministerial channels: functional necessaties of different ministries from different countries working with another country's ministry
        - Transnational Channel: social movement, economic, environmental issues to pressure government to make change
        - Lobby state to create policy to favour their scope of interest

## 3.3. **Psychological images**

- situation of uncertainty and flux could exacerbate the existing difficult approaches to FPM
- => cognitive inconsistency as changing contemporary global politics contradict individual belief systems.
- **The use of analogies**: looking back at historical solutions to problems and applying it to the present's problem.
    - As international system is changed, the past's solution won't work for today's context
    
    
    ðŸ’¡ Ex: Vietnam War vs Korean War solutions
    
    
    
- Exaggerating threats to national security...
    - US focusing on security against USSR while it's economy is in ruin

# 4. Comparison of FP making during a routine and crisis policy making process

- The manner of FPM differs according to the situational circumstances in which it is made.
- There are two groups of countries cantered their foreign policy differently than the other
- **The Core**:
    - military issues are of low significance
    - FPM is focused on economic interdependence: free trade, open economy, FDI, free labor flow.
    - mutually beneficial, and institutional linkages well-established.
- **The Periphery**:
    - military threats persist: FPM is focused on security
        - FPM in this setting is conditioned by the power and the influence calculations beloved of realists.
    - economic relations are characterized by underdevelopment and subordination
    - institutional cooperation is notable by its absence

## 4.1. Routine FP Making

| Routine FPM | Crisis FPM |
| --- | --- |
| Policy initiation based on incremental adjustment | Policy making as response to surprise event |
| Lew/moderate stress level | High stakes and stress level |
| Wide number of policy makers | Small number of policy makers |
| Braod range of options | Narrow range of options |
| Long lead time in policy formation | Limited time to respond |
| No likelihood of force | Likelihood of force |

# 5. FP Making in Different Types of Political System

## 5.1. Democratic

- Multiplicity of actors influencing the policy making process
- 3 sources of countervailing influence
    - The office of the executive is an elective one
    - Constitutional arrangements
    - The influence of other agencies of the state on the executive

## 5.2. Authoritarian

- FP attributes are determined by one leader's characteristics
- The concentration of power is rarely absolute because of political factionalism
- Political conflict isn't absent within authoritarian states
    - most authoritarian states has succumb to democratic pressure, civil war, and coups.

## 5.3. Transitional

- The survival of personnel and practices from the old regime
    - replacing administrative staff in security and governmental system is difficult to do
        - previous personnel are still hired
        - previous bad attributes of old regimes remains
- Continuity of political disruption: reordering institutions requires
    - Political fragmentation

ðŸ’¡ Applies to all Regimes: political executive is the most influential in FPM

# 6. Conclusion

# Models of FPDM

- Rational Actor Model (RAM) - realist thinking and rationality based on â€˜means-endsâ€™
    1. Define the situation based on objective assessment
    2. Specify the goal to be achieved and if there is conflict among them prioritize the goal
    3. Consider possible alternative means to achieve the goal
    4. Select the final alternative that is calculated to maximize achievement of the goal
    5. Take the necessary actions to implement the decision
- Organizational Process Model (ORM)
    - Different from RAM, OPM claims that the state of the national government is no longer a unitary or the most important actor.
    - Focus on the routines, standard patterns of behavior, and institutional perspective of particular agencies and their impact on FPDM.
    - Primarily, it includes key leaders in the top political organizations.
