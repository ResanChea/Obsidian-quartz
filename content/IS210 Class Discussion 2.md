1. The Cold War was a war between the Soviet Union and the United States, from 1947 to 1991, fought mostly through proxy wars and rarely any face to face conflicts. The two super powers fought for global influence

    Kennedy and Johnson administrations during the 1960s to justify increasing military involvement in the Vietnam War.
    
2. ~~Southeast Asian states sought ways to relate to each other on an alternative basis rather than simply choosing Cold War sides. SEA states had opposition to interference in domestic affairs by external communist or anticommunist agencies~~
    
    ASEAN states were concerned for their national security as non-communists could overthrow and take over the government.
