# Complex Interdependence

- The world is peaceful because itâ€™s interdependent
- Focus on relative gains of economic interdependence
## Power can be utilized in interdependence to create sensitivity and vulnerability[^1]
1. **Sensitivity**: the speed and extent of how changes in one country affects another
	- Social & political actions can be sensitive to changes also
	- Policies can be altered to fix the situation, but not before the economy is affected. (policy formation & implementation takes years)
2. **Vulnerability**: the costliness of policy change and the availability of alternatives after it is changed
	- Ex: if **A** can replace oil imports with cheaper alternative than **B** could manage, **A** would be better off
	- Weakness:
		- If one set of rules puts an actor in a disadvantageous position, that actor will probably try to change those rules if it can do so at a reasonable cost
		- economic vulnerable states may use military force to attempt to redress that situation as Japan did in 1941

# What are the characteristics of world politics under conditions of extensive interdependence? [^1]

- **International Regimes** (IRE): have important effects on interdependent relationships
    - IRE can cover functional relations between countries that govern resource sharing, commerce interactions, and communications on an issue-to-issue basis
- Rules and procedures aren't well enforced as domestic
- IRE are intermediate factors between the power structure of an international system (IS) and the political and economic bargaining that takes place with it
    - to some extent governs the political bargaining and daily decision-making that occurs within the IS
