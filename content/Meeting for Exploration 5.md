# Throughline

explains what it is

Throughline: Main theme of the story, short introduction to the talk

- Used in plays, books, movies, to make the story coherent
- The most important charactersitic of a talk to tie your story together, so its not too broad, confusing, or out of topic
- Make your delivery of the same information more interesting and captivating to your audience

Do(s) and Don't(s) of creating your throughline

- Shouldn't be clich√©, too positive, not digging deep enough, boring, doesn't bring new perspective to a common topic.
- Make it personal, unique, helpful, eye opening, not a story sharing talk either.
