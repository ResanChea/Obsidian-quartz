# [[references/The Rise of the International Organisation_ A Short History by David Armstrong (1981)\|Armstrong(1982)RiseInternationalOrganisation]] Chapter One: The United Nations in World Politics

# The Cold War (1946-1989)

The end of the Democratic vs. the Communistic of the bipolar super powers created the need of the United Nation's dealing with Peace and Security, environmental and developmental issues.

# 

The efforts of peacekeepings weren't of much success as lack of resources and funding from the UN's members.

# 

The United Nations

# What The Vision for The UN was In the Cold War:

# Days after WWII, the UN was created with the Charter, which improved on the failed LoN and earlier mechanisms, for many countries' fear of future conflict and to endorse cooperation.

# 

# What the UN really was in the Cold War:

# The WW2 great powers (US, USSR, UK, France and China) had rising tension during the founding of UN.

# During Cold War:

- Administering new members were vetoed from the opposide of allies
- Some issues and conflicts were never brought to the UN at all

# 

The Nuclear Revolution started by the US made the founding of the UN as a forum for discussion of Arms Controls and Disarmament.

# 

During the Cold War, peaceful Decolonization picked up as the UN Charter endorsed the colonial peoples.

# The norm changed to look down on imperialism or colonial powers and granting independence were a must.

# 

Group of 77(G-77), formed by 77 former colonies in the UN, concerned itself with the "North-South issues" or "the Rich-Poor issues" fighting for the Newly Independent States.

# 

The North-South Conflict

# By the late 60s, UN's focus was on economic development and relations between the rich North and the poor South. (steered by the G-77)

# The (NIEO) made by the G-77 during the 70s polarized the UN system as a whole and caused a divide between the North and South until the 90s.

# 

Integration or Fragmentation

# Integration

- Shared interests and vulnerability
- Communication Revolution
- Economic liberalism: emphasize the role of private sectors over government in eco. development.
- Democratization: spread in the 80s and 90s with links to the adoption of economics liberalism.

# Fragmentation

- The UN is was not designed to deal with intrastate conflicts, to which no actions an be taken.
- The Cold War's end filled new independent states with nationalism and ethnic conflicts

# 

To deal with both consequences is multilateralism: international activities in accordance with shared general principles.

# 

# The UN is a , designed to protect states, not biased, and address issues.

# 

Multilateral Diplomacy, in the form of international treaty laws, has spread to states, NGO(s) and other actors in cooperating and addressing human rights, environmental, and political issues.

# 

Contending International Relations Theories

Realists explains during the post WW2 era, States acts as the Unitary actor in the anarchic international system.

# IGOs and NGOs, as marginal actors, only reflect interests of their most powerful members, they rely on members willingness to cooperate and their funding.

# 

Liberalism is the more accepted perspective on the era

- Liberalists sees as actors in the international system.
- International system filled with interdependence, cooperation and conflict.
- IOs like UN alter state's behaviours and interaction with one another by establishing rules
- The international society consent to common rules and institutions and recognize common identity and "we-ness"
