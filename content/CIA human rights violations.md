# CIA human rights violations


- There is a vast array of international legal instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Geneva Conventions, that prohibit extrajudicial executions, “disappearances,” torture, and ill-treatment in any circumstance. [^1]
- The CIA, in particular, is notorious for encouraging (or associating with) those engaged in torture, ill-treatment, disappearances, and extrajudicial executions.
	- Torture victims are many times incorrect people
- The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has long been associated with the overthrow of governments and the installation of bloody military regimes.
	- Yet these violent overthrows and the operations of CIA-associated armed groups routinely involve such crimes.
