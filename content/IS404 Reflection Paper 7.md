[[CMRAI-C8  Negotiation\|CMRAI-C8  Negotiation]] 

Chapter 8 titled ‚ÄòNegotiations‚Äô starts out by breifing means of negotiations such as persuasion, accommodation, and use of force. It goes on to list the processes and steps in a negotiation as the initial planning & fact-finding, development of negotiating position, informal pre-negotiation discussion, exploration of one another‚Äôs needs, and finally direct bargaining. Preparations such as the negotiation setting of time, locations, and context are discussed. Formal bargaining is described the be in the very specific initial offer, followed by realistic bargaining and concession, and overcoming impasses along the way. The chapter explain the various strategies for bargaining for different context and opponent and the methods on how to break an impasse such as the possibility of gain, persuasion, ‚Äúcooling off‚Äù period, and seeking mutual benefits for example. Contentious negotiations, as opposed to collaborative ones, usually involves bluffs and threats with techniques of initial high demands and limited information sharing. While collaborative negotiators, even though still cares about their own interests first, would still consider mutual gain alternatives. Debacles can be overcome through apologies, approach drawing reciprocal treatments to step over deadlock situations. Collaborative bargaining might not happen as parties might have incompatible values and beliefs, the issue involves too much emotions, or the hold of ‚Äútake-it-or-leave-it‚Äù positions for example. Threats or power imbalances can cause the weaker states to lock up from giving concessions as well. Manipulative tactics can be adopted and states might save face. Effective negotiation requires good communication skills of active listening, paraphrasing, and showing respect.

From this chapter, I learned that negotiation situations can be very sensitive in its preparation, strategy, and existing preconditions. Each case must be handled differently as the combination of state, non-state, identity, ethnicity, and values differ in each case. However, the chapter gave general steps in the process of negotiation that applies to most cases. I also learned of strategies of breaking impasses that involves subtle concessions to get discussions and decisions rolling again.
