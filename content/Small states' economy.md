# Small states' economy

## Theories of Economic Growth

- **Lewis Model of Industrialization**: emphasize important role of industrailization and mass production as the determinant of economic growth. 
	- Process of turning low productivity labour-surplus agriculture to more technologically intensive large scale manufacturing
	- Moving unskilled and under employed low-productivity labour from the agricultural sector to manufacturing
		- Raising industrial productivity
		- Without reducing agricultural production

- Inapplicability of Lewis Model to small states
	- It assumes large population
	- Existance of large agricultural sector
	- Existance of large labor force

- New Growth Theory & Endogenous Growth Models
	- More domestic variables into calculation
	- More modern and accurate to modern world


# Determinents of Economic Growth in Small States

- Population, GDP/GNP, The Terms of Trade, Composite size & characteristics measures are the [[Small States\|characteristics of small states.]]

- The smallness of markets in small states make it so its hard to grow
	1. Limited domestic demand for efficient output
	2. Disadvantage in promoting R&D, technical progress & technology
	3. ...
- Structural challenges of the market makes small economies hard to grow

- Vulnerability sources
	- Economic: external trade, exogenous shocks, isolation, limited policy autonomy
		- Inability to take advantage of *return to scale* 
		- Rely disproportunately on foreign imports
	- Political & Strategic: limit foreign policy, external pressures, excessive defense costs
	- Environmental: natural disasters, climate change

- Location or geographic characteristic of small states

- Human capital
- Social Cohesion: not accepted empirically as important
- Political & Economic Policy Autonomy: decision-making without outside pressure.
	- Sacrificing sovereignty for more economic growth. It doesn't reduce growth. Small states can benefit from this relationship
		- Rent seeking
		- Free riding
- [[Globalization\|Globalization]] 


# Small Island Developing State (SIDS)
 
- **Vulnerability Index** of small island states to natural disasters and [[Climate Change\|climate change]] must be

- 5 vulnerability or challenges to SIDs
	- Small size
	- Insularity and remoteness
		- High per-unit transport
		- Uncertainties of supply
		- Large stock
	- Proneness to natural disaster
		- Cyclones, earthquakes -> Economic cost
	- Environmental factor
		- Pressure arising from economic development: economic cost of environmental protection
		- Environmental characteristic of SIDS: 
	- Other characteristics
		- Dependence on foreign sources of finance
		- Demographic factor
