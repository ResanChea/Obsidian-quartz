# Some say embassies are obsolete, while others think the opposite.

- After WW2 why some say [[Embassy\|embassies]] are obsolete? 
	- Modern development of communication and travel technology and the many multilateral meeting points (Ex: UN)
	- Embassy political reporting had been overtaken by the huge growth in the international mass media (replacing need for report of info)
	- Ideological divide made embassy staffs become hostages if a conflict were to break
		- Ex: US embassy in Iran

- Why embassies are and will be important 
	- Embassies are more prevelent than ever
	- As understood by [[Constructivism\|Constructivism]] and its importance of identity & symbol
		- Embassies are apart of the identity of 'statehood'
		- Quantity of embassies is a symbol of modernity of a state
