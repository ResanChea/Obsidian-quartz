# Introduction to Small States
# 1. History of Small State Study

- Scholars ignored small states earlier by
    - Assuming small states are not fully independent, are controlled by powerful states
    - Assuming small states can’t affect international politics
    - The use of traditional theories like Realism to explain world politics
    - Small states represent small proportion of world population → not important to study
    - Researching small states is time consuming
        - Many different cultures and perspectives, risky field work, western researchers
        - Lack of existing studies on small states
        - Not enough funding or is conditional (for studying funder’s country)
        - **Most Similar Comparison**: Inability to generalize from small sample
- Why small states became more important in the 1970s
    - [[Cold War\|Cold War]] used proxy wars through small states: making them more influential in world politics
    - Creation of **Newly International Economic Order** (NIEO): proliferation of new small states?
    - Changed conventional wisdom: [[Realism\|Realism]] focused more on Bandwagoning strategy, alliance building: small powers aligning with powerful states
- Why small states are important to IR now
    - There are many existing studies on small states now
- **Euro-centrism**: belief that non-western/European states are less civilized, and western culture is the only way to develop (Liberal economy, democratic political system)
    - Due to most researchers originate from developed states who gets funds to research developing countries

# 2. Definition of Small States [^1]

- The definition of small states is still not agreed upon one.
    - Theorists doesn’t believe a single definition of small states is possible
    - Empiricists believes a specific measurement of small state standard is possible
- Since 1950s definitions were based on
    - Population size (varies from 1 to 10 Million)
    - Economic Indicators (GDP/GNP, GDP per Capita)
    - Land Size: island/mainland
- Decolonization → more small states → new study redefine as “micro state’’ → merged definition with small state
    - Micro state: <1.5M population

## 2.1. Characteristics of Small States

1. Commonwealth Secretariat's definition: focused on economic indicators
2. **Economic characteristics**: of limited domestic opportunities, leading to
    - [[Complex Interdependence#Power can be utilized in interdependence to create sensitivity and vulnerability 1\|Sensitive & Vulnerable]]: Openness and susceptibility to adverse development elsewhere 
        - Vulnerable to economic crisis
    - Narrow resources cause specialization in a few export products
    - Dependency on few markets
        - Reliance on overseas aid
        - Reliance on preferential agreements (Cambodia with EBA)
    - Human & Financial Capital
        - Shortage in certain skills
        - High per Capita cost in providing government services
3. Environment: Greater vulnerability to natural disasters
4. Still lacking in population count, land size, 
5. Reactive foreign policy: adopting certain policies in response to external factors
    - Shape foreign policy to take advantage of certain situations
6. Lack military capability
7. Small Population: Ken Ross
    - Small states population: 1M-5M
    - Mini states population: 100k-1M
    - Micro states population: <100k
8. Soft power?

## 2.2. Weak/Strong State vs Small/Big State

- Weak states ≠ Small states
    - Usually confused in Realism
- (Barry Buzan, 1983, p65-69)
    - Strong states: high legitimacy
    - Weak states: low legitimacy
    - Strong powers: high capabilities
    - Weak powers: low capabilities

> Small states can be strong powers that can challenge large states (Iceland, Malta, Antigua)
> 

# 3. Small States Strategies

- **Bandwagoning**: aligning with powerful states or IOs for security protection (Cold War Bipolar World)
- **Alliance Building**: aligning with smaller powers (G77)
    - Collective security
    - Resource sharing: human capital
    - Punctual Military Test?
- Support **Regionalism & [[Institutionalism\|Institutionalism]]** have influence in competition with medium and big powers
    
	>[!example] Ex: Cambodia in [[ASEAN\|ASEAN]] to have bigger voice to talk with US, Europe, and powerful states.
    
- **Lobbying**: people who try to convince policy makers or leaders of another country to make decisions that benefits lobbyist’s own country
- **Neutrality**: not aligning with any sides
    - A state’s ability to be neutral depends on its geography and its importance for world politics.
    - Non-Alignment Movement
    - Problem: hard or impossible to measure or bind the level of biasness
