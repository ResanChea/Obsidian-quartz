# Regional Organizations and Human Rights
### **1. What is General Assembly Resolution 32/127 about? And what are the advantages of having the regional systems?**

GAR 32/127 mentioned the creation of regional systems for the promotion and protection of human rights, as it was needed to promote regional cooperation for the promotion and protection of human rights.

**Advantages of having the regional systems:**

- It seeks states in the same geographical areas to consider agreements to establish such a system.
- Request the Secretary-General to prioritise the discussion and establishment of the regional system.
- Appeal to the Secretary-General to submit a progress report on the implementation of the present resolution to the General Assembly at its 33rd session.

These systems do not prosecute individuals or decide individuals' responsibility for human rights violations. By creating and joining regional human rights treaties, States have agreed to respect, protect, and guarantee the enjoyment of specific freedoms for all people within their territories.

Shortly after the congress in Hague, Belgian Ministry of forieng affair, Paul Henri Spaak called for a creation of a European assembly, with wide-ranging powers, composed of member of parliament from various states and deciding by majority vote. And on march, 5, 1949, in St James Palace, in London, where the treaty constituting the statue of the council of Europe was signed, with 10 countries at that time that include: Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherland, the UK, Ireland, Italy, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. And as the years go on, more and more European countries join the Council of Europe.

### **3. The Organization of American States: *History, what they do, structure, and more focus and examples on human rights***

- The Organization of American States (OAS) is a regional inter-governmental body focused on human rights, electoral oversight, social and economic development, and security in the Western Hemisphere.
- Historically, The OAS was based on the ideas of the United States' Monroe Doctrine, particularly the concept that an assault on one American state was considered an attack on all. The OAS intended to "continentalize" the Monroe Doctrine, imposing duties on other countries while preserving the United States' prerogative to strike immediately in self-defense.

The importance of the OAS  is in regards to regional diplomacy in which its efforts are to increase regional security and commercial cooperation. The United States and twenty other governments in the Western Hemisphere signed the OAS charter in 1948, years after member states signed the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, the membership then has increased to 35 states with 72 permanent observers.

- The OAS's administrative backbone is the General Secretariat, which is led by a secretary-general chosen for a five-year term. The OAS's primary policy-making body is the General Assembly, which meets annually and is attended by foreign ministers or chiefs of state from member countries. The General Assembly oversees the OAS's budget and other specialized groups. Nevertheless, all collective action must be approved by the two-thirds majority of the voting system.
- The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights System is established by an OAS resolution in 1959 and entered into force in 1970, which works closely related to the hearings on specific topical areas of concern, publishes studies and reports, requests the adoption of precautionary measures to protect individuals at risk, and has established several thematic rapporteurships to more closely monitor certain human rights themes or the rights of specific communities in the hemisphere.****

The guiding philosophy was that of Pan-Africanism which centred on African socialism and promoted African unity, the communal characteristic and practices of African communities, and a drive to embrace Africa’s culture and common heritage.
