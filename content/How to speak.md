# How to speak [^1]

- Rules
	- Don't start with a joke
	- Start with a promise of what they'll learn by the end (topic sentence)
- Speaking isn't about showing the inside of your head, they want to be convinced [^2]
	- Only teachers are paid to care about how you believe things are
	
## Strategies to speaking
- Cycle your content 3 times: 
	- "explain something, expain it again, and explain it a third time"
	- At any point, 20% of the audience isn't listening
- Contextualize your point by comparing it to other things
	- Bargaining is different from neogiation in that it is testing the opponent's flexibility rather than just seeking a solution through whatever means.
- Verbal Punctuation: give audience a chance to start listening again after losing focus
	- Announce the start of a new major point
- Asking a question
- Emphathetic Mirroring: making the audience feel, relate, and understand what you're doing by doing practical things
	- Write things on the board
		- Rather than use power point slides
	- Point at the board, even if it doesn't relate to what you're saying, it focuses the listener
	- Use props
- Be passionate about what you're saying, its infectious


## The use of slides

- Rules of Content
	- Don't put many words on a slide
	- Get rid of background image junk
	- last slide
		- Don't use 'Questions?'
		- Use 'Contributions': what you've contributed to the topic, what has been discussed before, what you've found out new now

- Example:

- Don't need the bottom two logos
- Don't need the title: you can just tell them the title

- Use of slide
	- Don't use the lazer to point since it requires lost of eye contact
		- Use 'Arrow Number 1' and 2 instead

## Purposes of speaking
- Getting a job: what recruiter wants are
	- Vision: giving your understanding of the problem, and what approach you have that's new and exciting
	- Shown you're doing something: to try and deal with the problem
	- Contribution to the problem
