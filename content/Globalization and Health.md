# What are the negative impacts of globalization on human health and well-being?

## Individual Level

- Commodification makes products essential to health and wellbeing more available but not to all people equally
    - medicine is harder to produce for developing countries and drugs are costlier
- **Unhealthy diets** promoted by transnational commercial actors (fast food, sugar soft drinks, alcohol, infant food)
    - tobacco, drugs
- **Workers’ physical health**
    - harmful exposure to chemicles
        - Toys, Christmas decorations have harmful chemicals during production
        - No protective equipments
    - repetitive machine replaceable jobs
        - ‘repetitive strain’ & ‘musculoskeletal disorder’: repetitive physical movements
    - child labor
- **Workers**’ mental health suffers from **stress**
    - high psychological work demands
    - low level of task control, authority, and self-decisions
    - perceived or/and real risk from job
    - encouragement of overtime work stye, surveillance on efficiency and productivity to maximize output
- Economy Sensitive to instability and failure → Increased risk of **unemployment**
    - temporary job that’s bad for health and wellbeing
    - Waged Workers have access to health care insurences
    - How: accelerated movement of capital makes intense competition between places and workers, making unemployment in specific places
    - illegal migrant workers, refugees less labor rights

## State Level

- **Pandemic**, spread of infectious diseases (because increasingly mobility of people)
- Production of **food is able to sustain** the world’s population
    - But distribution of global production isn’t good [^2]
        - lots of export subsidies, less food domestically
        - There’s prevalence of food shortages
        - Competition conflict and wars over food and resources
    - Isn’t environmentally sustainable
- Urbanization: people clumping to population centers makes housing plans not work ⇒ shanty towns lacking sanitation, poor environmental condition, and disease.
- Air, water, land pollution from globalizing processes affecting health

## International Level

- North countries ‘brain drain’ South countries in the form of neo-colonialism where skilled workers train in Southern countries and goes to work in North countries. [^2]
- The rich north off-shore their pollutant and unsafe work to the South with less safety regulatory measures than in a developed state. [^2]
    - Trade in wastes (North→South)
    - Re procession of nuclear wastes between the North → concerns of radiation exposure to workers & local residents
    - The best predictor of location of toxic waste dumps in the US are the concentration of people of low income and of color.
- Inequality of gain
    - Developing countries gets less benefits
    - Political regulatory protect home state’s health and safety in powerfu states, but generate risk environment abroad (poorer states).
    - Unfair trade practices: developed countries put ‘export subsidies’ so they have advantage over developing countries’ agriculture products
        - Some say agricultural liberalization or stop of subsidies will increase global welfare and allow developing countries to hold 45% of total gain
        - Others say most developing countries are ‘net importers’ and would suffer because the price increase from subsidy lift
    - Transnational actors benefit more from liberalized trade
        - Large producers can invest in technology to increase output and lower costs

# Is globalization to blame or are people to blame for such negative impacts?

- The wealth seeking capitalist incentive encouraged by globalization makes the problem sort of inevitable
    - More and more transnational commercial actors, who aren’t bound by obligations like governments
        - Only want more output without consideration of workers conditions, consumer’s health, and food distribution
        - Food chains dump their left over foods all the time to disincentivize people waiting to get free food at the end of a day
            - As said, global food production is sufficient to sustain everyone on Earth **if distributed properly**
