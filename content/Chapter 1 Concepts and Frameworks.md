# 1. Conflict Resolution Models

## 1.1. Characteristics of Conflicts

- Conflict is a universal characteristic of human society, groups, international level that can't be eliminated
    - This will focus on macro-level conflicts
    - Conflicts is dynamic and can escalate/de-escalate depending on its context


ðŸ’¡ Morton Deutsch differentiate 2 conflicts:

- destructive conflicts is to be avoided
- constructive conflicts are necessary and valuable aspect of human creativity


- **Constructive Conflicts**: is one that we can minimize the negatives and maximize the positive aspect of it
    - strengthen relations between society members
    - promote peaceful co-existance
    - promote economic development

- **Destructive Conflicts**: are ones that usually at the stage of violence contact
    - hurt communications, relationship, hostilities, discrimination
    - block social-economic development
    - cost a lot financially and lots of life

## 1.2. Definition of Conflicts

- Conflict is the pursuit of incompatible goals by different groups often in related contexts of
    - fights: violent contact, military operations
    - games: competition, fight for resource scarcity
    - debates: the arguments of incompatible goals, ideology, values, perspectives
- The nature of the conflict: party positions in two contexts
    - **Consensual Conflict**: to fight over the same interests
        - normally economic or material objects (territorial dispute...)
        - disputes that are easier to resolve using economic incentives to reach settlement
    - **Dissensual Conflict**: more difficult to solve such as values disputes, non-negotiable
        - Conflicts: deeper struggles are harder to resolve need to find common ground for agreement

## 1.3. Managing a Conflict

- Managing a conflict's context could de-escalate it to a lower stage. How?
    - working with society members to address core of conflict to avoid violent uprising
        - conflicts based on old negative emotions could be fixed through reeducation, friendly interactions...

# 2. Positions, Interests, Needs

**Intractable Conflicts** are ones that are avoidable, and happens when the essential needs of countries (survival, security) is denied.

## Consensual Conflicts

- Consensual Conflicts can be resolves by figuring out and differentiating
    - position held by a party
    - their underlying interests and needs to find common interest for negotiation
- How to find the underlying interest and needs
    - can be learned by interactions and communication with the party (info exchange)


ðŸ’¡ Ex: Egypt and Israel's conflict

- Position: both want control of Sinai region (incompatible)
- Interest/Need:
    - Egypt wants to keep territorial integrity
    - Israel worry about state security
- Israel could rain security through different means or at some compromise


- Position can be changed
- Interests can be met in multiple approaches

## Dissensual Conflicts

- non-negotiable conflicts
- Satisfaction of the basic/essential needs of one country could reinforce the security of another country
    - States will work cooperatively if both is basic needs are satisfied


ðŸ’¡ US & USSR reached survival and security needs by Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty



# 3. Johan Galtungâ€™s Framework Model

- Solving a conflict involves a set of dynamic changes
    - de-escalation of conflict behavior
    - a change in attitude
    - transformation of the relationship or clashing interest at the core of the conflict strucutre
- Conflicts can come from the combination of three triangles: conflict, violence, & peace in society

## Conflict Triangle

- 3 forms of violence
- **Contradiction**: is the actual or perceived incompatibility of goals. It happens all the time in society which must be dealt with, addressed, transformed to avoid negative attitude
    - When the social structures *(institutions, law, government)* cannot fulfill social values *(8 pillars of positive peace)*, there will be negative attitude to the social structure
- **Attitude**: the perception of different parties, often influence by emotions
    - Negative attitude, if left unaddressed can lead to negative conflict behavior *(discrimination)*
- **Behavior**: cooperation or coercion through conciliation or hostility.
    - Violent conflict behavior come from threats, coercion, or destructive attacks and behavior

## Violence Triangle

- To gain structural/long term peace you must remove all 3 forms of violence
- **Structural Violence**: a form of violence where some social structure or social institutions may harm people by preventing them from meeting their basic needs (children die from poverty, inequality)
    - The responsibility of the state to satisfy its peoples basic needs
    - Restructure society: distribute resources to those who needs it
- **Cultural Violence**: is the cultural aspects in society that justify the structural violence the state is doing to the people
    - Cultural discrimination by policy makers to benefit one over the other from negative attitude
- **Direct Violence**: use of physical force, killing, intentional, and visible damage
    - crackdowns, murder of innocents
    - results from the violent behavior of conficts

## Peace Triangle

- 3 forms of peace: can be formed using
- **Peace building**: reforming structure of society to remove structural contradiction and to aim for sustainable growth for society
- **Peace making**: educating about understanding one another's differences, relationship building, remove negative emotions from supposed 'enemy'
- **Peace keeping**: third party uses peaceful means to resolve conflicts between the parties based on three principles
    - the consent of the parties involved
    - the impartiality of the peacekeeping force
    - the non-use of force except in self-defense or defense of mandate

ðŸ’¡ Ex: Khmer Rouge joined the Cambodian election, not eliminated through violent means.


# 4. A Conflict Escalation and De-escalation Model

- A conflict is dynamic
    - it can widen by drawing in other parties
    - deepen and spread by generating secondary conflicts within main parties or outsiders
- How a conflict scales up and scales down:

- ðŸ’¡ Conflict Escalation and De-escalation
	- Difference
		- Contradiction
	        - Polarization
	            - Violence
	                - War
	            - Ceasefire
	        - Agreement
	    - Normalization
	- Reconciliation

- De/escalation can skip steps either up or down

# 5. Hourglass Model Conflict Resolution

# 6. Theories and Frameworks

- Classifications of Theories
1. **Internal Theory of Conflict**: they locate the source of the conflict for the characteristics within the nature of the protagonists.
    - Individual Characteristic Theories: practice, conditions that influence individual's behaviors' violent/peaceful
    - Culture, Racism, Religions, Ideology differences
    - How individuals form into groups of like minded to achieve similar goals
2. **Relational Theory of Conflict**: look for sources in relations between the conflicting parties/groups/members
    - Interactions groups and their members interact within & among the other groups
        - How they come up with certain POV or behavior
        - Power relationship, nature of interaction between groups
    - Theory: Cause Benefits, Relational Theory, Constructivism
        - Adam Smith: how an individual pursue their interest according to their social interactions
3. **Contextual Theory of Conflict**: social, cultural, outside environments that condition and structure the actions that happen in the conflict
    - Prominent Theory: [[Marxism\|Marxism]]: the broken capitalism system forces the rich to subconsciously oppress the poor.
    - Institutional Arrangements that keeps the poor poor and the rich rich


## More Causes of Conflicts

- [[NiccolÃ² Machiavelli\|NiccolÃ² Machiavelli]]: conflict is the result of the human desire for self-preservation and power
- [[Thomas Hobbes\|Thomas Hobbes]]: the three principal causes of quarrels in a state of nature were (internal)
    - competition for grain
    - fear of insecurity
    - defense of honor
- [David Hume]: the underlying condition for human conflict were
    - scarcity of resources
    - limited altruism: lack of reciprocal actions

# 7. Edward Azarâ€™s Theory of (PSC)

- **Protracted Social Conflicts (PSC)**: are conflicts from pursuit of basic human needs
    - Rights & freedom
    - Security & survival
    - Recognition & acceptance
    - Economic particiation
- If these are absent: these social groups form into complex parties to ensure their needs separate from one another
    - could lead to ethnic conflicts: each groups look for their own benefits at the cost of another group's interest (win-lose)
- Why does it lead to **Protracted** Social Conflicts?
    - It's protracted because it's hard to deal with
    - Not obvious for solution: need to find shared interest, needs, and fears

## Four Preconditions for PSCs

1. **Comunal Content**: The identity differences between social, cultural, and religious groups that are treated differently in the context of society. Leading to multi-communal, fragmentation, discrimination, that divides society into having negative perceptions of one another.
    - Possible Solution: identity differences could be re-categorized into common identity
2. **Deprivation of Human Needs**: Failure to satisfy basic needs leading to dissatisfied social groups who are marginalized and will pursue their interests despite opposition from occupier.
    - Possible Solution: work on institutional restructuring for equal treatment, equal distribution of resources, unbiasedness
3. **Governance and State Roles**: Monopolization of power, limited resources, limited capacity of stay in control, and a crisis of legitimacy. Have R2P. If power is used to oppress or malicious ways, citizen groups will 
    - Possible Solutions: change structure of governance and need to work with IOs and make sure all citizens are equally cared for an equally represented without bias or corruption.
        - Remove social injustice, atrocities, equal treatment, fight against corruption
4. **International Linkage**: economic dependency on assistance from foreign states and political-military linkage is influenced by foreigners,
    - Possible Solutions: build institutions to remove global dependency to stimulation domestic economic growth independently

# 8. An Interpretive Framework for Conflict Analysis

Sources of Contemporary Conflict: a framework

1. Global:
    - North-South ideological, wealth/economic divide
    - Environmental Constraints: South China Sea, oil, fisheries resources
    - Weapons Proliferation: nuclear weapons, contest of military might
    - Ideological Contestation: Cold War, communism vs liberalism
2. Regional
    - Spillover effects between neigboring countries
    - Cross-border social demography, similar ethnicities grouping together across countries for same purpose?
3. States:
    - Weak Societies: from cultural divisions, ethnic imbalances
    - Weak Economies: from poor resources base, relative deprivation
    - Weak Politics: social/political differences between partisan gvernment, and doubts in regime illegitimacy
4. Conflict Party: Group mobilization, intergroups dynamics
5. Elite/Individual: leaders who have powers to influence supports.
    - Exclusionist policies they form policies that benefit one group but hurt others
        - Factional Interests
    - Greedy practice by elites
