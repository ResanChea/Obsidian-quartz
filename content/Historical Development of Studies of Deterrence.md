- 1950 (Golden Age of Deterrence):

	- It stresses
		1. Importance of defining commitments
		1. Communicating the comittments to adversaries
		1. Developing capability to defend them and giving crediblity to the commitments 
- 1960s: [[Thomas Schelling\|Thomas Schelling]] analyed deterrence as a *bargaining tactic* based on *tacit signals*
	- Credibility became a problem when deterrence was between two nuclear states: national suicide is not viable decision making
	>"Thomas Schelling (1966) went so far as to suggest that it was rational for a leader to develop a reputation for being irratinal so his threats might be believed."
	>=="Richard Nixon indicates that he took this advice to heart in his dealings with both the Soviet Union and North Vietnam (Kimball 1998: 76-86)"==

	- If you lie and get caught, you lose credibility. If you lie and deterred others successfully, you maintain credibility.
