What is global governance?

Global Governance are cooperative actions between actors in the international level to address issues which affect multiple states such as global security, peace, social, economic, and environment

Global Governance is a set of rules, ideas, and norms and state and non-state actors coming together to address problems in the world such as poverty, climate change, economic issues, epidemic, that all affect them all.

Why is Global Governance necessary?
