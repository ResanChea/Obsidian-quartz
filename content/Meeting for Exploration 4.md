Reflection in between

So as an exercise, after this session, I want you guys to share your idea to someone, maybe a friend, classmate, or family member. See their reaction, what they have to say about it, maybe it will help you come up with changes or a different perspective as a whole for your topic.

So at this point its the end of the discover section, it means that you should have picked or at least have an idea of what your talk will be about. You know, in exploration 1 we got to know each other and created your passion badge full of ideas you're passionate about. In exploration 2, you learned why an ideas is great. maybe its great because it gets people thinking, or something underappreciated, or maybe just a topic the speaker is passionate about is enough. Then in exploration 3, we learned how to give helpful feedbacks we learned about the 4 suits and you should only give helpful feedback which is... diamonds and spades feedback. And today, session 4, you've ranked your most valued topic at the top, ready to be developed. In later sessions, we will use the progress from this discover sessions to continue and build on one topic that is to be your best idea in the develop explorations.
