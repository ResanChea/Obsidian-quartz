# Neo-Liberalism

- Neo-Liberalism or Neo-Liberal Institutionalism is a newer take on [[Liberalism\|Liberalism]] describing the post-world-war world
    - argue that Anarchic world can have cooperation with help from International Organizations
    - Neo-Liberalism is a continuation of using [[Behaviouralism\|Behaviouralism]] as a source of knowledge

# Assumptions [^3]

1. **State is an important actor** in international politics.
    - States are rational cost benefit actors that try to gain **maximum self-interest before everyone else's interest**
    - States can
        - creates IO to serve their interests
        - affect the design of IOs.
        - overrule actions of IOs
    - **How cooperation happens**
        - States create IOs, but IOs will persist long after its goal has been achieved (NATO)
        - States have to give authority to IOs to use its technical expertise to manage activities states cannot all handle
2. Consideration of **relative power** could play a major role in international relations.
    - **Relative Power**:
    - States care about relative power more than anything else.
    - Relative power affects states’ bargaining power.
    - **How cooperation can happen**
        - But some issues are not security-related and do not directly affect relative power.
        - IOs can “link issues” together for states to bargain, thus avoiding any single issue that significantly affect then relative power balance.
3. **Anarchical International System**: No overarching authority.
    - There is nothing to punish cheaters.
        - But only in one-off relations
    - States look out for their own security.
        - Relations are mostly iterative or repeating ⇒ no one will work with a cheater ⇒ cheating has a cost
    - IOs are instruments of the states, not world government

# Characteristics

- More state-centric view of IR than [[Liberalism\|Liberalism]] [^1]
    - States are rational actors
    - States are selfish but mutual benefit is better than self-interest
    - States have Incentive to Cooperate: to maximize absolute gain
- There are several barriers to cooperation:  [^3]
    - Possibility of Cheating
    - Free-riding
    - Self-interested states
    - Competition for relative power
- Neoliberals offer institutions as solutions to these problems [^3]
    - **Iteration of interactions** and transparency: offered by institutions
    - Advance in communication technology allows **states to monitor each other**, detect and punish cheaters.
    - **IOs** provide forum for frequent and **regular meetings**, allowing states to negotiate to find common ground and work for beneficial gains.
- 1. The Cumulative Progress of humanity will accumulate and will only get better [^3]
- 2. Prisoner's Dilemma: talks about the barriers to cooperation ([[Game Theory\|Game Theory]]) [^3]
    - Realism: The optimal solution for mutual benefits is cooperating and remaining silent in the interrogation room
        - **Uncertainty**: Mistrust & Fear of being cheated are barriers of cooperation
    - **Prisoner's Dilemma game theory is outdated**
        - Its harder to cheat: Now states have ways to monitor each other's compliance with agreement using technology (satellite imagery)
        - Prisoner's Dilemma only see cooperation happening once
            - If you cheat, your reputation of cooperation and trustworthyness drops for future cooperation and interactions
- 3. **Collective Action Problem**: its hard for a group of actors to get together to solve collective problem due to free riding [^3]
    - **Free ride**: as the problem if solved benefits everyone and doesn't matter who contributed, states have incentive to wait for others to solve it for them instead of helping (global warming)
        - If everyone free rides the objective will fail because it does need contributions
- 4. [[Hegemonic Stability Theory\|Hegemonic Stability Theory]]: if a hegemon achieved preponderance of power and brings stability, they discipline those who don't comply with the system [^3]
    - US established public goods for its own benefits, but It benefited everyone in the system (international institutions)
    - Hegemon will solve barriers to cooperation (prefer unilateralism?)

# Functions of IO In Mitigating Anarchy’s Effects on Cooperation

- Neoliberals study how international organization are created, for what purpose, and how they are designed to mitigate the adverse effects of anarchy. They identify three issues:
- Bargaining:
    - Create common rules and procedures.
    - Issue-linkage.
    - Regional vs. global institutions.
    - State’s leaders can sometimes prefer apparently legally binding rules to deflect the difficulties involving domestic opinion.
        - States would rather listen to unbiased IO instead of other states because public criticism
- Defection:
    - States want to lock one another into the institutional arrangements and the agreements that have been signed.
    - IOs deal more with how to manage cheating then how to prevent it altogether.
    - IOs create an incentive structure to increase compliance and strengthen enforcement: rewards, sanction, issue-linkage...
- Autonomy:
    - Technical expertise and information: more trust worthy than ideologically biased opinions of states
    - Agenda-setting.
    - Management of global daily affairs

# Four Strands of Neo-Liberalism [^2]

- [[Sociological Liberalism\|Sociological Liberalism]]: transnational relations, between people, groups, and organizations between nations.
- [[Interdependence Liberalism\|Interdependence Liberalism]]: interdependent countries rarely voluntarily get in conflict with one another.
- [[Institutional Liberalism\|Institutional Liberalism]]: formal and informal institutions can facilitate states' relations, cooperation, and collective security.
- [[Republican Liberalism\|Republican Liberalism]]: liberal democratic states don't go to war with each other
