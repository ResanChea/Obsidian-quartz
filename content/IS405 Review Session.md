# [[Realism\|Realism]]

- These are the basic ideas of Realism that all branches of Realism shares (Structural, offensive, defensive, strategic, classical, neo-classical Realism)
- Main idea is **Anarchy**: order of international relation
    - doesnâ€™t mean chaos, no overarching authority or world government
    - cooperation can still exist
- **States** tries to survive under anarchy
    - to survive you need to know the rule of the game
    - to master the balance of power
        - Build own power compared to neighbors, to protect one self & to not threaten others
- There is only **material power** or hard power
    - Economic power: sanctions are coercive nature
    - Military power

# [[Neo-Liberalism\|Neo-Liberalism]]

- Same basic assumptions as Realismâ€™s **anarchy**
- **Interdependence** affects the behavior of states
    - Connectivity â†’ Sensitivity: making states more vulnerable
    - States think twice before going to war (it costs a lot more)
        - Military powerful but isnâ€™t everything
    - IO can deal with problems which material power and states canâ€™t deal with alone
        - Problems of Cheating
        - Free riding
        - Environmental problems
- **International regime**: is also very important (similar to Constructivism)
    - Thereâ€™s New order: interdependence require states to work with IOs â‡’ therefore institutions are important

# [[Constructivism\|Constructivism]]

- [[Social Constructivism\|Social Constructivism]]
- Constructivism observed the world and interpreted the world differently than Liberalism and Realism
- There exist a social interaction between different actors
- Types of Power
    - Compulsory power
- 4 Types of Authority: itâ€™s not power, itâ€™s ability to convince people youâ€™re in control
    - Institutional Authority
    - 
    - 
    - 
- 4 Politics: (find it in the transnational advocacy network)
    - Accountability Politics
    - 
    - 
    - 
- All actors that have authority or power will need to work with states to deal with problems of the world
    - Global Governance: is the process of interaction between decentralized inclusion of all actors who have any amount of authority
- Weakness: they didnâ€™t explain why all these assumptions work
    - Constructivism discoveries are only done very recently, why wasnâ€™t it discovered thousands of years ago
    - Itâ€™s assumptions are more or less correct, but why is it only applying now
    - Constructivism piggy backed on Neo-Liberalismâ€™s assumptions of the three revolutions
        - Information revolution
        - Communication revolution
        - Transportation revolution
    


ðŸ’¡ Takeaways

- Realism is too narrow
- Neo-Liberalism gave us new order
- Constructivism gave us more actors, types of powers, and authority, but didnâ€™t give credits to Neo-Liberalismâ€™s developments


- Only sometimes these 3 theories have competing assumptions and explainations
    - It depends on the case & context
    - Policy recommendation: you must judge which theory is better to explain this
- A theory must have (theory vs approach)
    - ontology: where their knowledge comes from
    - epistemology: what their assumptions are
    - methodology: looking at identity

- What are the most compelling argument for each theory?
- Use one or more theories to apply to a case study, event.
- Case study
    - [[Ukraine-Russia Conflict\|Ukraine-Russia Conflict]]:
        - Ukraine asks to join NATO â†’ Balance of power change â†’ Russiaâ€™s existential fear: Realism describe better
        - How would Neo-Liberalism explain it?
            - Economic Interdependence: Russia fears the change because billions of dollars of investments in Ukraine
        - How would Constructivism explain it?
            - Democratic norms are rising â†’ Ukraineâ€™s democracy & join NATO â†’ Existential threat of Russia
    - China threaten Taiwan invasion
        - More bluff than real threat: no country announce a war before taking actions
            - No surprise advantage
            - Taiwan and allies could mass troops and position them ready
            - It would cost China too much: US is still more powerful
        - China doesn't have the war time experience or veterans to run a war properly. The last war China was in?
