### Summary of main points

1. The [[Belt and Road Initiative\|Belt and Road Initiative]] is not just a economic strategy to get rich, its also a political strategy to set up navel bases along important maritime trade routes.
2. [[China\|China]] funds foreign projects while requiring the use of China's own construction company, therein putting its investment back in its economy rather than the host country.
3. China is building a 'String of Pearls' along the Indian ocean to gain economic, security, and geo-political control of waters in the East.

### Highlights and Notes

- China requires that the projects it fund through the BRI, bust involve construction companies from its country.
    - Means construction money goes back into China's economy instead of foreign companies.
- BRI is a trap because it's willing to lend money to unreliable countries
    - Corruption and conflicts in these countries make them less likely to pay back
- Its not just for economic benefits
    
    Ex: Sri Lanka let China fund building its port.
    
    - Sri Lanka can't pay back, it gave the port the China for 99 years
    - Pakistan also have a 40 years lease
