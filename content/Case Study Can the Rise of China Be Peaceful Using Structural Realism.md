# Case Study: Can the Rise of China Be Peaceful? Using Structural Realism

# Can the Rise of [[China\|China]] Be Peaceful?

- Different [[Structural Realism\|Structural Realism]] see the rise of China a different way
    - Offensive Realism: US-China competition → central war
    - Defensive Realism: US-China balance of power → peace

## [[Offensive Realism\|Offensive Realism]]

- the best guarantee of survival is to become hegemon
    - global hegemony is not practical or sustainable
    - regional hegemony is possible
  >[!example]-
  >US attained regional hegemony in Western Hemisphere in 1898, not global hegemony.
- Regional hegemon wants to stop regions it doesn't control from having another regional hegemon
    - It wants the uncontrolled regions to be divided and competed for among great powers and not with the regional hegemon
  >[!example]-
  >- United States stopped 4 potential regional hegemons during its reign:
  >	- Imperial Germany
  >	- Imperial Japan
  >	- Nazi Germany
  >	- Soviet Union
- Offensive Realists says **China's next step** in becoming a regional hegemony is
    - to maximize the power gap between China and its neighbors
    - to try and push US's military presence from Asia
- Offensive realists says **US's reaction** to China's rise will be
    - to try to contain and weaken China
    - to regain control or re-balance Asia
- Offensive Realists says China's neighbors
    - will fear China's rise
    - will join the US in containing China's power
   >[!example]-
   >Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and China all joined the United States in containing the rise of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
   
## [[Defensive Realism\|Defensive Realism]]

- Defensive Realism agrees that China will want more power, and its neighbors will join the US to contain China.
- But it doesn't make sense for a great power to seek hegemony because its neighbors will join another regional hegemon and great powers to defeat it.
- Nuclear Weapons will be a [[Deterrence\|deterrence]] for aggression
    - India, Russia, and US all have nuclear weapons and relatively close to China
    - Japan also can easily get nuclear weapons (US?)
    - These countries will also form a coalition to stop China if needed
- China has no incentive to conquer other Asian countries
    - China's economic growth isn't because of foreign endeavors
    - In the age of nationalism, there would be fierce resistance from the population if China decides to dominate them
        - The benefits is smaller than the cost of expansion
- Defensive Realism says China will aim for limited power in Asia
    - it won't try to dominate Asia, but just to 'make China great'
    - therefore China is easy to contain and cooperate with
- Defensive Realists still leaves open that the rise of China might not be paceful due to similar '**domestic political pathologies**' that Imperial Germany, Imperial Japan, and Nazi Germany made

## Other Structural Realists Perspectives

- A Structural Realist who believes in **uni-polarity** for peace believes China's rise will replace uni-polarity to bi-polarity and could lead to multi-polarity in the future. Because the number of potential war partners increases it's more war prone.
- Some Structural Realists believes **bi-polarity** is more peaceful than uni- or multi- as the case with the Cold War and the lessons learned from it.
- Structural Realists who believes in **preponderance peace** says China's rise will threaten the security of US who will have strong incentive launch a preventive war against China.
