# Populism

- What is populism:
    - five ingredients that lead to populism:
        1. a rise in immigration
        2. an increase in inequality
        3. the perception of corruption
        4. a major financial crisis
        5. the demagogue: politicians who appeal to the peopleâ€™s displeasures and prejudices rather than rational argument
- Populism was explained to only be popular in poor countries
    - Irrelevant Explanation: uneducated, poor, gullible to charismatics instead of good policy
    - now: developed countries also led by populism presidents (ex: Trump)
