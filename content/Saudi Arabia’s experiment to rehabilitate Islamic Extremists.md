-   Religious Sub-Committee:
    -   The largest of the four subcommittees
    -   Approximately 150 clerics
    -   Directly engage detainees through prisoner dialogues and counseling
    -   Conduct course called
    -   Understanding Jihad
    -   "Right jihads" and "wrong jihads"
    -   "Proper time" for jihad
    -   Emphasis is on avoiding takfir
-   Psychological Subcommittee
    -   Uses experts in psychology, psychiatry, and social sciences.
    -   Assess the social status of prisoners and diagnose any psychological problems.
    -   Most of the counseling that the inmates receive is focused on helping them to develop healthier family relationships.
    -   Counselors spend considerable time with the prisoners and reportedly get to know them well.
-   Security Subcommittee
    -   Uses experts in psychology, psychiatry, and social sciences.
    -   Assess the social status of prisoners and diagnose any psychological problems.
    -   Most of the counseling that the inmates receive is focused on helping them to develop healthier family relationships.
    -   Counselors spend considerable time with the prisoners and reportedly get to know them well.

## Program Environment

-   On arrival, each prisoner is given a suitcase filled with gifts: clothes, a digital watch, school supplies and toiletries.
-   Inmates are encouraged to ask for their favorite foods.
-   Volleyball nets, PlayStation games and Ping-Pong and foosball tables are all provided.
-   Families also play an integral role in the rehabilitation process. Relatives are encouraged to visit prisoners and become involved in the Counseling Program.
-   New prison facilities were specifically designed to accommodate family visits, including shared meals and meetings with scholars.
## Post-Program Release

-   Most prisoners complete the program within two months.
-   Upon release, each former jihadist is required to sign a pledge that he has forsaken extremist sympathies; the head of his family must sign as well.
    -   Due to Tradition: Saudi’s head of family signing a pledge, if a person break it, they are dishonorable
-   Some also receive a car and aid from the Interior Ministry in renting a home.
-   Social workers assist former terrorists and their families for education, employment and, usually, marriage.
-   98% Success Rate
-   **Problems**
    -   Experiment in Indonesia: failed
        -   Terrorists are more well-versed and converted instructors
    -   Programs rely on terrorists having been detained.
    -   Have program "graduates" actually changed their views or are they simply being more careful?
    -   Even with those who have changed, is this change long-lasting?
    -   How effectively can governments maintain long term monitoring?
    -   Post-release monitoring focuses internally; little evidence of tracking terrorists' activities in other countries.
    -   Probably more chances of success with sympathizers and junior personnel than with the more seasoned terrorists.
