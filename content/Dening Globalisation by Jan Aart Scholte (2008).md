# Globalization Defition

- Globalization Coined in second half of 20th century
- Globe came from 15th century Latin
    - later defined the world as a sphere
- Global circulated in 17th century and added the meaning of 'world scale' in 19th century
- Globalize and Globalism appeared in 1940s
- Globalization first used in 1959, in dictionary in 1961
- Globality circulated in the 1980s

- It got translated to many languages
    
    > The vocabulary of globalisation has also spread in other languages over the past
    several decades. The many examples include the terms lil ’alam in Arabic, quanqiuhua
    in Chinese, mondialisation in French, globalizatsia in Russian, globalización in
    Spanish and utendawazi in Swahili. In minor languages, too, we now ﬁnd globalisaatio
    in Finnish, bishwavyapikaran in Nepalese, luan bo’ot in Timorese, and so on.
    > 

- The new terminology came into popularity, not because of a fad, but because of necessity to define the change of context in society, how people interact, and the rise of nation-state.
- ideas of globalization it appeared independently in different fields roughly at the same time (1980s) in Sociology, Business, International Relations, Economist, Geographers
- United States Library of Congress's mention of 'globalization' multiplied from 34 in 1994 to 5,245
- Globalization appeared in education,
- Since 2000s
    - Global Studies Associations in Britain and the USA:
    - Globalization Studies Network with worldwide membership
- before globalisation can be treated as a serious scholarly category, it must be properly have clear, precise, explicit, consistent and cogent conceptualisation first.

# Weaknesses in the Definition of Globalization

- Definition of Globalization through Internationalization, Liberalization, Universalization, and Westernization are unoriginal
    - Arguments that build on these conceptions fail to open insights that are not available through pre-existent vocabulary
    - People reject the novelty and transformative potential of globalisation in contemporary history because of these definitions
