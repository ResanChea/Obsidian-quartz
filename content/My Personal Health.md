# My Personal Health

- Half your carbs such as rice, noodle, bread... Rice isn't needed for every meal. The meal is the meal itself not the rice.
- Buy cleanser to wash your face of dirt 2 times a day
- Buy moisturizer. Dry skin makes more oil. Clogged pores makes pimples come up. It doesn't feel good to put on but it's worth it
