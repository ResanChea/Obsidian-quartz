## How is an embassy organized?
- Ambassator leads an embassy, most powerful in public
- Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) can take charge when ambassator is absent. Role can be named different:
	- Minister
	- Minister-counsellor
	- Counsellor
- Embassy Premises or Building Organization
	- Residence of the Chief of Mission
	- Chancery: traditionally administration , political , economic-commercial , defence , public diplomacy , cultural , consular , Others Topic Related sectors: Nuclear energy sector, Narcotics & border sector
	- Problem of isolation between different sectors teams => Ambassator as the boss of a one-team mentality
		- Could still lead to conflict of what should be prioritized
- Supported by administrative, technical, and domestic staffs
	- Domestic staffs because cheaper, locally engaged, knowledge and language skills. But with no diplomatic protection
