# Chapter 6: International Political Economy

IPE = Politics (State) + Economics ( Market)

Studies the interaction between politics and economics in international relations.

Divided into 3 Theories:

- Mercantilism
- Economic Liberalism
- Marxism

# I. Mercantilism

## 1. Assumptions

- Economic activity is the subordinate to building up the state's power
- Economics is the tool used for political actions
- Economic strength and state's military-political power is complementary, growing each other
- Economic competition is "zero-sum game", one must win, one must lose

## 2. Types

- **Benign Mercantilism**: States look after economic interests as it's important to the state's security (Defensive)
- **Malevolent Mercantilism**: states attempt to exploit others through expansion (Offensive)


ðŸ‘‘ Mercantilism is similar to Neo-Colonialism. Exploiting smaller states with soft power and economies.



## 3. Modern Examples

- State Intervention: state involvement in national economy to change for better economic system. (protectionism)
- Protection Policy: protectionism (Trade War)
- Productive Power:

# II. Economic Liberalism

## 1. Assumptions (autonomous)

- Markets expand by itself to satisfy supply and demand
- Market economy will operate using its own mechanisms and laws
- The central actors are individuals (consumers)

**Principles of Free Market**

- Individual Rights: everyone has equal ability to defend our liberty, and participate in economy.
- Limited Government: to secure individual's rights only
- Equal Justice Under Law: government must treat every individual equally, no ranks
- Subsidiarity: government has the lowest authority
- Spontaneous Order: unregulated supply and demand for individuals â‡’ competition â‡’ best economic benefits
- Property Rights: leave resources to private sectors...?
- The Golden Rule: require honesty between individuals

---


âš™ Spontaneous Order: is a system when left unregulated, competing buyers and sellers will bring in the best outcome for the economy.



- When is Government Intervention necessary?
    
    When there is Market Failure.
    

# III. [[Marxism\|Marxism]]

Karl Marx  thought reforms from Liberalism and Realism aren't enough. Instead a revolution and overhaul of every system is necessary.

- Capitalist based on two actors
    - Bourgeoisie: owner of production, middle class
    - Proletariats: Owner of Labor power, working class (bound by bourgeoisie)
- Bourgeoisie exploits proletariats
- Demands 'Social Revolution' to replace every system

## Neo-Marxism

### 1. Cox's analytical framework

World Orders

Forms of States

Social Forces

### 2. Dependency Theory

Development of Developing countries rely on development of developed countries

- Primary Commodities: Unfinished products / Raw materials

^

 |    Primary sold to rich, rich sells back more expensive value-added products

 v

Value-added Products: changing primary commodity adding more value to the product

- **MNCs**

- **Aids and Support**

Richer states can have influence on governance of poorer states through aid

### 3. World System Approach

Focus on Center-Periphery States

- Core: Rich (West)
- Semi-periphery: Industrializing (NIE)
- Periphery: Poor (East)

Core exploits periphery through neo-colonialism
