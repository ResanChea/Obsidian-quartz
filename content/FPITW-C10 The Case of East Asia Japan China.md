Although the MFA is the most actively involved in dispensing Japan's foreign policy functions, the small size of its staff in comparison to MITI and MOF, plus MIT! and MOFs' control over Japan's economic relations, ensures that understanding Japanese foreign policy entails appreciating the interaction between these ministries, as well as the other ministries and non-governmental agencies

- Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affiars (MFA) had small staff compared to MITI and MOF
- MITI and MOF controls Japan’s economic relations & manage interactions between ministries and NGOs

: 320

Japanese foreign policy is conducted by a myriad of organisations that include a plethora of government ministries, the Japanese private sector, and what Kent Calder (1997) refers to as 'para-public' bodies. The poor levels of coordination within and between these bodies help to explain Japan's lack of decisiveness in decision making in the foreign policy arena.

: 321

MFA exercises exclusive control of official communication from overseas. This can, and does, cause inter-ministry coordination problems because of the MFA's lack of openness.

: 321

The importance of an economic issue to Japanese society often favours the Kacho from MIT! or MOF, since these Kacho are able to harness the activities of a number of interest groups.

: 321

issue centres on a core societal value, such as nationalism or pacifism, that an MFA Kacho can use the public's support as leverage over his counterpart.

: 321

The result of this suspicion is that ministries such as MITI and MOF use their own independent channels of communication via para-public institutions. japans mfa trys to get the spotlight

- Kachos from different ministries try to make themselves the only one who can determine what happens with Japan’s economy and security

: 322

With a weak executive the decision making arises out of the bifurcated relationship of MITIIMOF and the MFA, with occasional appearances from other ministries, that can best be described as partisan.

: 323

incremental or even vacillating, rather than bold and decisive.

: 323

by shielding its domestic market from the exports of other countries, Japan has essentially prevented the emergence of a Yen bloc, which would be a clear indication of its leadership position.

: 323

In view of japan's weak executive and the sectionalist and partisan attitude of the ministries, plus Japan's unease over its self-identity (is it Asian or not?), it is not difficult to appreciate that Japan has failed to assume the role of leader.

: 323

When official relations between Japan and another state are nearing a nadir, these private business organisations can help to prevent a further decline.

: 324

In his 'Look East' policy, Mahathir called for a replacing of Western influence with the more relevant development strategies of Japan and South Korea.

- Flying Geese theory: if you become powerful, the weak others will follow your footsteps
- Japan won’t open its market freely
    - Japan export its products, but barely import Asia’s products
        - No Yen Block

: 324

japan exports but doesnt import Japan, however, proved reluctant to play this role. Japan's failure to act as a leader can be seen in its trading relations with its 'followers'.

: 324

Throughout the 1980s the flying geese theory of development gained momentum, and as the 1980s drew to a close Japan had, with its technical prowess, emerged as the recognised Asian leader with the Asian Newly Industrialised Economies (ANIEs) of Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, then the ASEAN members, and finally China, following behind.

: 325

The failure to liberalise its trading policies and the stagnation of its own economy are the key reasons behind Japan's inability to emerge as the region's explicit economic leader

: 325

Japan, though, has shielded its market from the ANIEs and ASEAN members, and where Asian exports have succeeded' in the Japanese market the government has succumbed to domestic pressure to block their import.

: 327

The story of APEC highlights the failure of Japan to take an economic leadership role. It was Clinton who provided the impetus and Suharto who provided the Asian perspective.

- Yen Block: Group of countries using Yen as the international currency
    - Would be good for Japan
- APEC: only sets goals “to reach this number by 2030...”, not detailed plan
- EAEC: failed due to Japan’s lack of will to become the leader
