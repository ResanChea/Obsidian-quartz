# Classes in Coding
- A class is the template for the standard from which [[Objects in Coding\|Objects]] are made from it
- Data Encapsulation: to hide a variable from manipulation. Ensuring the variable can only be changed via a method of an Object from the Class.
	```js
	//From class of BankAccount(), object 'account' can only change balance via object.method()
	account.deposit(50);
	account.withdraw(20)
	```
