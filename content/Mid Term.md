# Comprehension Questions

# 1. Explain the process of FPM?

- Rational Actor Model (RAM) - realist thinking and rationality based on ‚Äòmeans-ends‚Äô [^1]
    1. Define the situation based on objective assessment
    2. Specify the goal to be achieved and if there is conflict among them prioritize the goal
    3. Consider possible alternative means to achieve the goal
    4. Select the final alternative that is calculated to maximize achievement of the goal
    5. Take the necessary actions to implement the decision

üí° Five frameworks for the making of FP [^1]

1. **Four broader steps**: (1) identifying the problem, (2) searching for alternatives, (3) choosing an alternative, and (4) executing or implementing the alternative.
2. **Six steps of FPDM**: (1) framing, (2) agenda setting, (3) options, (4) decision, (5) Implementation, and (6) Evaluation within individual, governmental and social scale.
3. **11 steps of FPDM**: (1) Goal setting, (2) information gathering/intelligence, (3) option formulation, (4) option planning, (5) option programing, (6) decision making, (7) implementation, (8) monitoring, (9) appraisal, (10) modification, (11) memory storage and recall (achieve)
4. There are **five types of FPDM** based on the situation the FP is made: (1) one-shot decisions (single decision in a particular single case), (2) interactive decisions (decision made by at least two actors), (3) sequential decisions (a series of interrelated decisions), (4) sequential-interactive decisions (similar to 3 and involved by at least two actors), and (5) group decisions.
5. Another way to classify **FPDM is based on the issues**: **macro** (about regional and international) issues, **micro** (domestic or administrative) issues, and **crisis** (urgent/unexpected) decisions.

## 1.2 Do States always follow strictly the steps in FPMP?

## Individual Level [^2]

- In the FPD, it depends on the individuals that make those decisions
- FP makers aren't always fully rational. Influenced by Emotional, cognitive, psychological and sometimes biological factors
    - Cognitive Factors
        - **Seeking cognitive consistency**: ignoring inconsistent information that contradict their existing view therefore making mistake in their decision making
        - **Wishful Thinking**: to justify own's decision, human often convince ourselves the choice will succeed
        - **Using Heuristic Devices**: Using stereotypes to generalize and make decisions easier without guilt or injustice
    - Emotional Factor: emotional decisions can lead to mistakes and dangerous decisions
    - Psychological Factor: frustration and anger can turn into aggression without logic in decision making
    - Biological Factors: animalistic nature of gender can determine the likelihood of use of war
    - Perception Factor: people see the world in different perspectives than others. These differing perspectives or perceptions can overlook other's perspectives and thinking us is better than them.
- The considerations of rationality that are central to the different accounts are supported by three arguments.
    - Policy makers themselves often claim to be acting in a rational manner.
    - It considers the distinctive nature of foreign policy.
    - Iterates to the seeming simplicity and analytical elegance of the idea of rationality itself.
- Yet, the rationality assumption has not been without its detractors, certain problems, which are the terminological, and the general point relates to the nature of the policy-making unit.

- No, there are many actors, agents, and institutions involved in this process.
- External Environment: there are many actors, agents, and institutions involved in this process.
- the leader influences the decision making process indirectly depending upon
a number of conditions like the interest and knowledge of the decision maker on the issue is at hand.
    - Belief system
- The political culture of a decision maker define how they set national interests, security, and peace

Not all FPDM have to follow a strict routines, it usually depends on the situation. Sometimes some steps will be skipped.

- [Cognitive School of Thoughts]: leaders/individuals aren't always as rational as we think they are [^3]
    - Human nature aren't always rational, they make mistake, and overlook obvious things
    - Cognitive Fallacy
        - Groupthink: a cognitive fallacy where people want to fit into popular decision/option in fear of being isolated, left out, and being wrong.
        - Cognitive dissonance: when leader try to ignore negative info, having biased pre-assumptions,
        - Cognitive consistency: attempting to recreate past glories using same method for different situation

# 2. Does a state‚Äôs power distribution (or national capabilities) predict what sort of foreign policy its leaders will pursue? Why or why not? Provide specific examples to support your ideas.(25%)

- **The Core**:  [^4]
    - military issues are of low significance
    - FPM is focused on economic interdependence: free trade, open economy, FDI, free labor flow.
    - mutually beneficial, and institutional linkages well-established.
- **The Periphery**:
    - military threats persist: FPM is focused on security
        - FPM in this setting is conditioned by the power and the influence calculations beloved of realists.
    - economic relations are characterized by underdevelopment and subordination
    - institutional cooperation is notable by its absence

Dualists emphasize the difference between national and international law, and require the translation of the latter into the former. Without this translation, international law does not exist as law. International law has to be national law as well, or it is no law at all. If a state accepts a treaty but does not adapt its national law in order to conform to the treaty or does not create a national law explicitly incorporating the treaty, then it violates international law.
