# [[Alexander Wendt\|Alexander Wendt]]

Born: 1958

Nationality: Mainz, German

Education: BA from Macalester College. PhD from the University of Minnesota.

Career: American Political Scientist and Educator

- he taught in many universities before joining the political science faculty of Ohio in 2004

Famous Works: 

- [[Anarchy is what States Make of it (1991)\|Anarchy is what States Make of it (1991)]]
- "Social Theory of International Politics" 1999

This essay established him as the leading thinker of constructivism and the book in 1999 expanded on his idea from the earlier essay.

## Assumptions

(1) states are the principal units of analysis for international political theory; 

He denies the focus of assumptions made by neorealists and neoliberalists  He says that states are not bound by unchanging generalization such as human nature, as selfish, or states' nature, as self help. These are not  what defines states' interests. And so he put states' interests as the foundation or fundamental unit in studying international relations.

(2) the key structures in the states system are intersubjective, rather than
material; and **page 220**

The key structures in the international system, refers to the system of anarchy, cooperation, or institutionalism is constructed through the process of states' interactions and their shared ideas. Meaning if enough people believe the same thing it must be or will become true. That shared 'competitive identities and interests' that creates an anarchic competitive self-interested structure in the international system. Because states interactions shape structure in the international system

Key Structures: cooperation, self-interest

Harder to achieve are institutionalization, power asymmetries and collective action

(3) state identities and interests are in important part constructed by these social structures, rather than given exogenously to the system by human nature or domestic politics

States' interests and identities are a result from the structures. Meaning that states' interests, goals, and identity is shaped gradually by their interactions with other states and their shared values rather than by the assumptions that seem inevitable.

Constructivists have stated that the reality that encompasses us is not in itself an outcome of the objective forces but is the result of one of our shared perceptions, ideas, social values and understanding.

These social structures and the shared values are what give the states' their interests and identities.

In [[Anarchy is what States Make of it (1991)\|Anarchy is what States Make of it (1991)]], Wendt criticized flaws of both neorealism and neoliberalism that core principles of both theories are socially constructed and can be transformed by change of human practices

'Social Theory of International Politics' emphasized the focus on norms and shared values rather than the materialistic and individualistic motivations 

- It attempts to bridge the gap between rationalism and constructivism
- He formulated three modes of socializing coercion, calculation and belief

Way of being & method of studying/arguing

- Ontological: what is important to look at
    - Realist Ontology: human nature and assumptions made static and unchanging
- Epistemological: what is worth asking

Criticize the view of inevitable assumptions

- If agents (states) cannot have any effect on the structures, why even instruct them how to act in the first place

Wendt supports Structuration:

Idea that agents (states) and structures don't live independently on each other and have effects on one another which could reproduce or transform each other

Question: Do you believe its justified that the idea of assumption should be replaced with states as the main unit of studying international relations? Why?
