	- Access & quality
	- Costs

- 12 grades compulsory education instructed in Spanish
	- But schools are underfunded and lack in resources because Mexico is diverse in language
		- Tertiary enrollment doubled from 1.9M in 2000 to 4.4M in 2017.

			- Still much lower numbers of students than other Latin American countries
		- Compulsory upper-secondary education plans by the government didn't help with rural areas
