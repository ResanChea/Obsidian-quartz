# Explainations to Regime Change

## Technological Advancement

- Technological advancement leads to increase in international regimes and more advanced
- When power of states change rules in international regimes also change
    - The winner/more powerful controls the regime change
    - The hegemonial system may use this to its own collapse
- Limitations
    - Explaining regime change using only power is only one part of the story
        - Applies to Cold War more
        - There are other factors: domestic politics, interests, issues
        - lack of differentiation of power among areas

## Issue Structure

- There are no linkage among issue areas
- The strong in the area makes the rules
    - States will pursue national interest, but the strong will dominate
- Limitations

## Interantional Organizational Model

- Set of networks, norms, and institutions, once established, will be difficult abolish
- Limitation:
    - IO will only apply if the complex interdependence condition is stable
    - May be wrong, states will want to change regime

Combining

- Economic issue: technological and economic change ---  regime change
- Overall structure: strong military-security state linkage to economic issue
- Issue structure: no or slight linkage, so power resource of vulnerability dominate
- International organization: examine how actors benefits more than other & how international organizaion persist
