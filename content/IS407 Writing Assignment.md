Although, as described previously, affirmative actions has not solved all problems of discrimination, it has led to some significant progress in the many fields and decades it was utilized. From 1973 to 2003, the government policy has been increasing diversity in workplaces in the United States, according to a study in 2012. Female and minority representation increased, especially for federal contractors since they were subject to equality regulations by the government themselves. In the education field, The supreme court ruled in 2007 that race must not be a deciding factor in school enrollment, effectively ending the formal racial segregation of communities in schools. Moreover, much of the progress in non-discrimination came from affirmative actions of executive orders from presidents. Franklin D. Roosevelt, during the second world war, signed an executive order to bring all hands on deck for workers of all ages, races, and backgrounds to work for the defense industry. Although the intention wasn't to improve race integration in the workforce, it was an important first step. President Dwight D. Eisenhower banned racial discriminative hiring in the federal government in 1953. President John F. Kennedy's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity expanded on Roosevelt's racial non-discriminative hiring to cover all federal contractors, not just in defense. President Lyndon B. Johnson mandated that race, color, or origin must not be determinant of treatment in employment or the workplace as well, to which Nixon added disability and age as those protected criteria as well. The bigger question is "If affirmative actions didn't exist, would the world be better or worse off?". It can be said that 'Having something is better than having nothing'.
