	- Phnom Trap was considered outside the 1962 judiciary and wasn't decided if it's in Cambodia or Thailand.

**The Aftermath**

- Both Cambodia and Thailand were satisfied with the resolution and had their military maintain peace along the border. However, the two country still needs to work out how to implement the judgement. While Thailand still need to reshape its foreign policy and resolve its domestic issues, the negotiation of the resolution kept being put off. 
- In January 2011 a group of about 2,000 began protests against the government, accusing of failing to safeguard Thai sovereignty in a border dispute with Cambodia. Unless this problem is dealt with, the deal from the ICJ won't be officially finished.
