# Abortion

- Why should abortion be legal?
	- Parents might not have the finance, resource, or time to take proper care of the child
	- Ban on legal abortion could lead to attempts at self-abortion which is dangerous for the mother too
	- Victims of rape should not have to bare the child of the perpatrator
	- Parents might abandon baby to die after giving birth or later on in life (to die) if they can't take care of the baby
	- Decision should be in the hands of the mother and father, not a political party
