- **Foreign Policy Arena** is the Terrain on which FP decisions are made and actions taken. It refers to both **physical features and potential resources** including human capital, economic capability, political power, etc.
    - This FP arena is occupied by a range of significant forces (actors, issues and interests).
        - Context of Actions
        - Forces of Actors

# Contexts

- What is FP context?
    - Similar to [[Kenneth Waltz Images of IR\|Kenneth Waltz Images of IR]]
        - International context
        - Governmental context
        - Domestic context

## International Context

- International context is the most important concern for policy makers
    - because **uncertainty of environment**
        - global uncertainties
        - shifts in balance of power
        - hegemonic order
        - hierarchical international system
    - FP is responsible for maximizing gain and minimizing loss
    - How
- How to evaluate impact of international concext and access its change?
- 3 Dimentions of Change
    - **Location of Activity**: center of importance, econmic gravity, and global focus
        - Cold War's concentration of Europe to Post-Cold-War shift to Asia, Africa
    - **Focus of Activity**: Emergence of new issues: shift of focus to economic, social, environmental concern in their decision making and policy making
        - Environment: climate change, natural disaster
        - Socio-Economic issues: corruption, poverty, unemployment, inequality, refugees
        - Prolonged and new security challenges: interstate wars, civil wars, refugee crisis
        - Geo-strategic and geo-economic competition: [[Belt and Road Initiative\|Belt and Road Initiative]], Quad, AUKUS
            - sphere of influence overlapping each other
    - **Instrument of Activity**: the means to get to the end: soft, hard, and smart powers
        - [[Realism\|Realism]] ideological warfare, using economic or military pressure.
        - [[Liberalism\|Liberalism]] Now soft power is more effective due to interdependence

## Governmental Context

- State-centric appraoch with traditional assumptions
- Government is the representative of the national state, claim for sovereignty and security.
- According to Chapter 1 Traditional FPA assumed that “ all government have the same principle, even though each had a different version of the foreign policy problem.
- In recent year, it has become ever more apparent that the government structure for foreign policy making are open to challenge and change.
- One element of those has been organizational restructuring to reflect change in the International context.
- Another type of challenge within governmental context of foreign policy making has been growth and diffusion of government itself.
- In the Western society, the scope and scale of the government machine had increase. ( Globalization, Regionalization and proliferation of new state and organization)
- The net effect of development in the government context is that the long establish image of foreign policy as the preserve of a skilled diplomatic.
    - In some case, it maybe modified by the limitation of government capacity and structure.
    - In other case, it maybe modified by the sheer extent of the structure.

## Domestic Context

- Pattern of communication and information sources makes it so domestic politics is influence by the support and pressure of non-state actors
- Implicit in much of what we have said so far are important arguments about the role played in foreign policy making by the domestic context.
- Domestic views of foreign policy, except in times of major national crisis, have often been described in terms of a restricted ‘attentive public’ and a great mass of those who are uninformed and uninterested.
- It is not surprising that such restricted views of the domestic influences on foreign policy have come under pressure, but the results of the pressures are not all in the same direction.
- But there is another side to this coin.

# How to evaluate context of FP

- FP arena is occupied by a range of significant forces
    - Context of actions
    - Forces of Actions
- 3 Interrelated contexts to frame or structure FP: to examine important forces of actors, issues, and interests

## Actors

- Who makes FP?
- Political and bureaucratic elites who have power and authority to influence FP
    - Must look at political circle of FP making
    - Background: education, social, family
    - Capacity, quality, personality
    - Worldview, perception: conservative, reformist, radical
    - Political experience in FP formulation
- The concentric circles of power in foreign policy making:

## Issue

- Issues of security have a high priority for allocation of national resources
    - Warfare (for independence or sovereignty) vs. welfare for Cambodia?
    - National security — traditional and non-traditional security issues
- New security challenges/non-traditional issues (e.g. Al in IR4.0...)
    - Cyber-attacking software
    - Data crunchers
    - Automatic machines: drone strikes, sattelite spyware,

## Interests

- The idea of national interests is fundamental to traditional notions of FP
    - Change in actors can lead to change in interests
    - Change in issues can shape actors and interests
