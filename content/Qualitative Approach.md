# Qualitative Approach


is one of the approaches in research that studies variables which are un-measurable by numerical representation such as human, social actions, and identity.

### Research Variables

represent groupings of things (e.g. the different tree species in a forest). Types of categorical variables include:

- **[Ordinal](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/ordinal-data/)**: represent data with an order (e.g. rankings).
- **[Nominal](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/nominal-data/)**: represent group names (e.g. brands or species names).
- **Binary**: represent data with a yes/no or 1/0 outcome (e.g. win or lose).
