- The new right: seeked the balance between tradition and free market economy while never abandoning tradition, authority and discipline. (libertarian)

# 3. Ideal Conservative Visions

States should play a bigger role in efforts to preserve these.

- System of Governance

Original Sin of Man: individuals, without restriction, will cause chaos and take advantage of each other, producing chaos.

# Discussion

1. Why and to what extent does conservatives support traditions?
    
    They support tradition because it has survived the test of time, therefore the stability should be preserved. People of the past who created them should be honored by continuation of practice.
    

2. Is conservatism a ‘disposition’ rather than a political ideology?

Nature: people are born with same values they will carry the rest of their lives.

Nurture: people are born as blank pages, where society and the community will write and shape who you'll grow into
