# Coercive Diplomacy
- Coercive Diplomacy is the act of forcing an actor to pursue diplomacy using coercive tactics such as economic pressue/sanctions and military force.
- Elements of effective coercive diplomacy:
	- limited objectives
	- coercive but limited use of force
	- the possible use of carrots along with sticks
## 1. Limited objectives
- [[Alexander George\|Alexander George]] said coercive diplomacy has defensive rather than offensive obejctives
	- Type A Diplomacy: for opponent to 'to stop short of the goal'
	- Type B Diplomacy: for opponent to 'undo the action'
	- Type C Diplomacy: for opponent to 'cease of hostile behaviors, by changing the existing structure of the government regime of opponent'
		- Stretching what is 'defensive'
	- Problem: **what is defensive is subjective.**
		- Preventive actions could seem defensive for the initiator, the further build up of opponent state could be seen by themselves as self protection
## 2. Coercive but limited means
- [[Compellence\|Compellence]] is different from coercive diplomacy in that
	- Coercive diplomacy seeks to influence, but not deny choice to the target.
	- Compellence is much more dependent on coercive threats to influence an adversary

> "The use of whatever amount of force it takes to get the adversary to change its behavior"
## 3. Sticks and carrots
- Coercive diplomacy must involve the threat or actual use of force
	1. Degree of emphasis
		- Coercive measures
			- Economic Sanctions: if this exist, but not threat of force, its not coercive diplomacy
			- Military force
	2. Existence of Positive Inducement (Carrot): the incentive and benefit gained for the opponent if they listen to the convincer
		- If carrot is better than the stick, its not coercive diplomacy

- War is not coercive diplomacy
	- When war happens, coercive diplomacy has failed
- **Strategic Coercion**: focuses more of the use of force than diplomacy

- Coercive Diplomacy vs [[Deterrence\|Deterrence]]
	- Deterrence is 
		- 'to dissuade an adversary from undertaking a damaging action not yet initiated'
		- More of intimidation than persuation
	- Coercive Diplomacy being 'a response to an action already taken'
		- Focus more on persuation
