The February 20, community transmission incidence has led to spikes in confirmed Covid-19 cases and an increasing number of deaths due to the virus, forcing the Government of Cambodia to adopt laws and regulations and necessary measures to curb the spread and get it back under control.

Cambodia implements health measures just like any other government around the world, struggling to control the coronavirus raging in their countries. Well, there are a few outliers whose leaders don’t believe in science and let millions of their people be infected and hundreds of thousands of people die unnecessarily of Covid-19.

What I don’t understand is that why the UN rapporteurs criticised the Government of Cambodia for “the necessary measures” to protect the lives of its people?

Well, to be fair, they said they expressed “serious concerns” over the measures adopted by Cambodia, which to many people is not far from “criticism” considering how they did it.

What is disturbing to me is that they criticised without mentioning other similar measures adopted by other governments around the world, which made it sound like only Cambodia took such measures. I would not know this either if I did not do the research.

This means Cambodia is “being singled out for criticism”.

So, what did the UN rapporteurs say about the measures adopted by Cambodia? They said that the Law on Preventive Measures Against the Spread of COVID-19 and other Severe and Dangerous Contagious Diseases allows 20-year prison terms and fines of up to 20 million riels ($5,000) for those convicted of violations, implying that the punishment is harsh; and that the law grants the government power to ban or restrict gatherings or demonstrations. They are of the opinion that restrictions on such public health ground should not breach rights and freedoms guaranteed by international human rights law, must be proportionate, non-discriminatory, time-bound and purpose limited.

Does only Cambodia have these kinds of penalties and fines for rule breakers? UK residents travelling from countries which UK considers are high risks and breaking the rule it set, face an imprisonment of up to 10 years, and a fine of between $7,000 and $14,000.

In South Korea, the fine for breaking the quarantine rules is $8273; in Saudi Arabia, it is $53,300. The list goes on. The rationale of the measures is simple: deter people from risky behaviors which could get themselves and others infected. Considering the fact that one of the four UN rapporteurs is from the UK, it is interesting that they did not bring up such information.

According to the Cambodia law, those who break the quarantine rule are fined between Riel 1 million ($250) and Riel 5 million (1,250). Harsher penalties and heavy fines are reserved only for those acting with more serious consequences to the society, such as escaping from treatment centers or hospitals, infecting others intentionally and under a clearly organised criminal enterprise.

Compared with penalties and fines in other countries, penalties and fines prescribed in the Cambodian law are not any harsher and should not be a cause for any serious concerns. Accordingly, Cambodia should not be unfairly singled out.

The Law on Preventive Measures Against the Spread of COVID-19 and other Severe and Dangerous Contagious Diseases says during the Covid-19 pandemic the government “may” impose restrictions on travel, gatherings or business activities considered high risks or sources of the spread of Covid-19, and lockdowns on areas or zones where the virus is spreading. Do such measures exist in other countries? It is clear here and I don’t have to give examples here. Many countries including the US and those in the EU like Italy, UK, France, Germany, etc. have imposed lockdowns, banned gatherings or any events considered to be super spreader events. In the UK, you will be fined if you organise a gathering of about 15 people.

Do the countries mentioned above breach the rights and freedom guaranteed by international human rights law? What are the rights guaranteed? Freedom of movement? Freedom of assembly? How about the right to life which Cambodia is trying to protect? Did the UN rapporteurs raise any serious concerns over measures adopted by countries in the EU? Cambodia has just banned traditional wedding receptions, and business activities considered to be high risks, imposed curfews and lockdowns on some quarters and villages and banned inter-province travels as the cases has spiked since the February 20 community transmission incidence.

Are the measure disproportionate? Considering how contagious the virus is, the number of people who may die from the virus as can be seen in other countries, the fact that Cambodia is still a developing country struggling to find necessary resources to fight the virus, and the huge tasks before the government to help those affected economically, the measures, are not as harsh as those in other countries, and are aimed to curb the spread, and protect the lives of Cambodian people as a whole and should not be considered to be disproportionate.

The UN rapporteurs also raised a concern over the public disclosure of personal data of those infected citing possible discrimination and stigma. In my opinion, the concern is blown out of proportion.

Covid-19 is a disease caused by coronavirus, with symptoms being similar to cold. It is not a sexually transmitted disease that deeply stigmatises those infected. In the last few days, authorities are struggling to bring in for treatments those who tested positive.

Cambodia may not possess advanced technological capacity to conduct its contact tracing quick enough, so the disclosure may help inform the public and those infected to come forward and receive treatments. Speed is crucial in the fight against Covid-19.

Supposed the government loses its control, the confirmed cases surge, the number of deaths rises, the economic impacts on the people get more serious, and the ordeal drags on, what would the same UN rapporteurs say?

Would you be willing to overlook and give up the right to life in exchange for short-term freedom of movement, and freedom of assembly during the pandemic?

Cambodia needs to keep up its good fight. Strict measures, quickly getting the spread under control, and quick recovery are crucial for the fight against Covid-19 to avoid prolonged hardships.
