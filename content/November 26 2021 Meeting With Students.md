    - Can you remember all of the script
    - Have you practiced and how long did it take
    - It would like about 20 minutes to present the whole thing, that is considering you don't pause much for
    - Speech
        - I like that you reference researches for your arguments
        - You don't sound as confident about the script yet
        - Know when to switch your slides, and make it natural
- Do they have any problems with their speech
- Schedule recording day
- Do we schedule a rehearsal day too?
- Phosatey
    - sounds very confident
    - sympathetic tone to connect with audience emotionally
    - or at least people said so (scientifically proven)
    - very similar to old and corrected ones
    - not remember script yet

Layheang ~~11am - 2pm Any Weekdays~~ 5th December
