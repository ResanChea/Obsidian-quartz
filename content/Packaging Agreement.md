# DTAP-C05: Packaging Agreement [^1]

- Do these questions at home and answer in class
    1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of packaging an agreement (formally) in the form of a treaty?
        - Formal vs informal package: there is hidden agenda ⇒ negotiations could collapse
    2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of packaging an agreement informally?
        - What is formal & informal packaging?
        - Why states prefer one or the other?
            - Big states
            - Small states
            - Cambodia prefers which one?
    3. Briefly explain the methods commonly used by negotiators to save face.
- Packaging an agreement happens at the very end of the negotiation
    - When parties promised what they will each do
    - Parties might not agree on how they package it: formal or informal
    - If not careful, negotiations could be thrown out at this stage
- [[Treaty\|Treaty]]ies are usually called conventions, concord, declaration, exchange of correspondence, pact, agreed minutes
    - Title of treaties are only reserved for topics of important matter
        - Ex: North Atlantic Treaty [[NATO\|NATO]], Treaty of Listborn
    - Actors call agreements treaties to emphasize it's importance
    - Peace Treaties
    - Treaties of Guarantee: agreements of all important guarantees of territorial or conditional settlements

# What form the agreement is depends on

1. Subject matter
2. Political needs of the author: if the authors of the agreement think it is of best political importance but does not warrant creating a international legal obligation, it won't be a treaty of binding international law
    - Instead they dress it in a fancy way like the Atlantic Charter and Helsinki Final Act
- **Formal Treaty**: if the subject is appropriate to be a regulation or international law
    - It signals the issue is important
    - Why use treaty if many criticize it as ineffective: because it's the most widely honored, even by unsavory states
    - Because breaking a consensual treaty is much more looked down upon than a bilateral agreement
    - Problems:
        - Take a long time: for parliaments to support, not fit for urgent matters
        - Parliament could just reject the treaty to gain public support to win the next election
            - Waste of time drafting the complex text and negotiation
- **Informal Agreements**: are for convenience and routine agreements
    - Non-binding agreements or unpublished
        - Problem:
            - An unbinding agreement in one leadership could be easily dropped by the next administration, especially in democratic states
            - Not easy to monitor compliance to agreement
            - The lack of transparency to the mass public
            - No ratification process, someone can just reject agreement
    - Advantages: Inconveniences avoided by using informal agreements:
        1. The complexities of formal treaties: informal benefits smaller and newer foreign ministries as well as large and overburdened FMs due to less added workload
            - Informal letters of offer and reply letters of acceptance is the most common form of treaties nowadays
        2. Ratification of agreement: no longer negotiators signed → political leaders disagree and doesn’t ratify agreement
            - Due to communication revolution: no error of communication
            - Ratification only existed for negotiators misinterpreting commands
            - Governments usually prefer no ratification: put into force quicker, no time for change of mind or ratification failure
            - Ex: US uses “executive agreements” which are treaties by definition, but doesn’t require ratification
        3. Informal agreements are used for commonly held principles/objectives: that is non-binding, but everyone agrees with
        4. Unwanted publicity: informal agreements isn’t required to be published. 
            - Avoid stirring domestic political parties: agreements can be published to be binding, but in informal style to avoid attention
            - Avoid give helpful info to enemies states.
- If ratification can’t be avoided, governments must use ‘Double Edged Diplomacy’

# Saving face

- Saving face: sensitive negotiation don’t want to be publicized
    - Concessions if public could bring backlash from supporters
    - What one party want to disguise, the other will want to highlight
    - If unpopular, negotiations could fail in packaging
- Strategies of Saving Face
    1. **Language** is the most fundamental to nationality and pride to be translated to both parties’ state of origin:
        - it reflect relationship of of equality and contain an equal exchange of concessions between both parties
        - Problem: One side’s language could be interpreted differently. Therefore there should be a third language which is usually English
    2. **Small Print**: disguising a concession in complex writing
        - By saying very little about it, brush it under the carpet, add trivial details unrelated to the concession
        - to place embarrassing concessions in documentary appendages to the main text
            - side letters, interpretive notes, appendices, additional protocols
            - make it less likely to attract attention
            - Problems with this
                - in a complex and tense negotiation under great pressure of time, there is more chance of a slip-up: might not do its job
                - it can subsequently be claimed that ancillary documents do not have the same value as the main text of an agreement
    3. **Euphemism**: covering up meaning of concession in text
        - Calling sending loans or money as humanitarian or foreign assistance or aid instead
        - Ex: Japan calling reparations after WW2 as financial assistance to countries it invaded to save face.
    4. Putting the concessions in separate but related agreements, while highlighting the safe one
