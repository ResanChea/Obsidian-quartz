Balance of power

## Alliances and Alignments

Balance of Power limitation

- Not all alliances form for balancing against stronger state
- States can choose many potential states as alliance

## Alliances and the liklihood of war

- Treat alliance as institution not actors

## How Alliances establish credibility

- Make sure alliances join in military activities
- Station troops in each others territory
- Joint decision makings

Differences of Alliance and Collective Security

### Alliance

- States with same interest
- have institution to manage

### Collective Security

- Small number of states
- Assumption that states have common interests, in preventing war and aggression
- Open to universality

### Organization

- Provide humanitarian aid in crisis states
- "collective security" to deter aggressors
- Prevent inter & intra conflict
- maintain peace

### Threat

- Determine what action will be taken

### Intervention I

- Deter from further aggression

### Intervention II

- Enforce peace agreement

### How it influnce bargaining power

- Involvement from other members
- Deter the breach of commitment
- 

- Freerider: dont contribute much but want benefits

### Joint Decision making problems

- Determine threat: States vote to their bias of national interest, not justice
- Differing Interests: P5 veto resolutions towards crisises
- Resulted in bias

## Institutional Responses to challanges of collective security

- Consent and contribution of major power

# Experiences of collective security

- Determine actions against level of threat against peace

## UN in Cold War

- UN couldn't act for the first 50 years
    - Greece Civil War
    - Korean War: soviet veto, alliance with NKorea

## UN Post-Cold-War
