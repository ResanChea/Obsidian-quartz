- History of birth rates
	- intense demographic increase between 1930 and 1980 due to the "Mexican Miracle"
		- Government invested in efficient social programs that 
			- reduced infant mortality rates
			- increased life expectancy
	- Nowadays, birthrates are plummiting
		- Good thing because Mexico has had an issue of overpopulation which leads to illegal immigrations to US [^2]
		- There's more women of childbearing age than ever before, but no one wanting children (?)
			- Explanations
				1. There's more contraception and family planning knowledge
				1. "Demographic Transition": where modernizing states have less kids in general as time goes on (?)
