189,660 families (884,041 individuals) who left Myanmar for Bangladesh

- Most settled in **Cox's Bazar**'s refugee camps (Bangladesh)
    - UNHCR managed
    - Unofficial settlements
    
    Feb 2021: UNHCR tracked 878,000 Rohingya in the camps
    

# Remaining Problems:

- Intentional fires, fear government is pushing residents to leave
    - Barbed wires preventing refugees from fleeing fires quickly
- Bangladeshi government try for refugees to move to island in Bay of Bengal, built to house Rohingya refugees
    - 13,000 moved
    - Are in path of cyclone
    - Are treated like prisoners
- COVID-19 cases increase rapidly
    - Stricter restrictions → bad mental health
