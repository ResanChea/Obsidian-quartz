# Reservation
- A statement made by a state to which article it accepts and which it does not accept.

- A state may be a member state even if it doesn't accept some article of the treaty.
	- Some conventions have articles which are critical to the purpose of the convention => cannot accept reservations that conflicts with that
	- Reservation available articles are stated by the treaty itself
		- In interpreting past treaties, states will find exploitable meanings in their favor
- Why are there reservations?
	- Some reason with "The preservation of cultural practices and values"
		- Ex: ISlamic countries with Sharia law

- **Problem**: if state doesn't accept some part of the law, the law might not be as effective since it was made to work together
