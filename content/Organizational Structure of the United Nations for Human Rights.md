# Security Council

- R2P
- Only UNGA used to discuss human rights, it stopped when UNSC took over the discussion
    - UNSC was reluctant because it only concerned security issues, and not push interventionist policy
- **Self-Determination**: UNSC advocated for all people
- **UN Interventions**: Security Council has been involved increasingly in international humanitarian work
    - Intervention for humanitarian aid and human rights issues
    - With consent of host state
    
    
    üí° Cases:
    
    - Former Yugoslavia (1992): threat to peace justifying intervention
    - [[Somalia\|Somalia]] (1992)
    - Palestine/Israel (2022): peacekeepers truth observers, and relief workersin Israel and surrounding
    
    
- Sanctions:
    - UN sanctions are rare (Southern Rhodesia & South Africa)
    - The most comprehensive UN sanction was on Iraq
    - Libya:
        - due to violent unrest
        - protect civilian population
    - Syria: sanction has not been supported by P5 of UNSC
    - Due to sanctions‚Äô effects on civilians population
        - Infant mortality rose & public health deteriorated in Iraq
        - General Comment And 8 of CESCR: ‚Äúlawlessness in one way (violations of human rights) shouldn‚Äôt allow lawlessness in another (sanctions)‚Äù
    - Unilateral sanctions are more popular recently: US.
        - EU also impose sanctions: voted for sanction against Syria, but lift all against Myanmar
- Problem with UNSC: it‚Äôs less likely to take actions against any P5
    - China: human rights abuse in Tibet
    - US instigated military actions in [[Iraq\|Iraq]] & [[Afghanistan\|Afghanistan]]
