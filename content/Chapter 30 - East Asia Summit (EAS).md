**ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF EAS** 

- How and why was EAS created in 2005
- What differentiate EAS from ARF and APT?
- Why include outside powers, esp. Australia, NZ, India, Russia and US?
- Why US engaged in EAS in 2011? Why not in 2005?
    - The renewed U.S participation can be traced back to the election of Barack Obama. The EAS used to be inimical to the US interest, nonetheless it was embraced in the latter with great emphasis on diplomatic means. For example, the first Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) saw the first priority in adapting to the new international environment as ‘building our capacity to organize ourselves regionally and work through regional organizations’. For the Chinese and Japanese political leaderships, this new approach on the part of the US is not necessarily seen as undermining either unilateralism or hub and spokes bilateralism but rather as a potentially useful adjunct. It is also a reactive approach prompted by concerns with China’s increasing global activism and the interdependence between the US and China strengthened by the global economic crisis. The rise of China’s military power in Asia, and its increasing assertiveness, is seeing a related increase in American influence. The political and economic elites of the smaller Asian and Australasian countries are keen to balance and hedge against China.
