# Poverty in Mexico

- Between 2018 and 2020
	- the population living in poverty increased by 7.3%, 
		- from 51.9 to 55.7 million inhabitants, 
	- the population living in extreme poverty grew 24.1%
		- from 8.7 to 10.8 million. 
	- The increase in the population with a lack of access to health services  
		- went from 16.2% to 28.2%.

## The Cause of the poverty rate

- **Low quality of education**, a lag in education is inevidable to a lag in progress
	- Mexico has been fighting for years against teacher unions that ask for a lot and give a little in return, 
	- That is why the quality of public education is much lower than what it should be. 
	- Public education is difficult to obtain and is inefficient
	- This is a severe issue because poor early education leads to a poor human development index (HDI), 
		- which in turn shows low achievement and aspirations of future personal adn professional advancement
		- which results in the famous poverty trap.

## Unemployment

- **Inequitable distribution of income,** Mexico's wealth is unevenly distributed among its people 
	- where 10 percent of the nation's wealthiest have 42.2 percent of all income
	- 10 percent of the nation's poorest have 1.3% of the remaining income. 
	- In spite of efforts by government officials during the past three administrations such as 
		- transition to globalization,
		- the NAFTA agreement;
		- Mexico has been unable to create efficient public policies in order to compensate for 
			- the distortion of its market
			- the poor distribution of national income

- **Absent competitive principles,** The Mexican economy does not support unprivileged businesses, considering its current standards regarding monopolies, both in the public and private sectors. 
	- By law, there are public monopolies: 
		- government-owned companies controlling oil and gas, electricity, water, etc. 
		- Private sector monopolies and duopolies are found in the media, television, telecommunications, and raw materials.
	- For this reason, clear principles of competitiveness that offer incentives to private investment, both national and foreign, are needed in order for jobs to be created.

## Government and politics:

- **Transparency and Corruption,** The lack of government transparency has led to administrative corruption, market inefficiencies, and income inequalities. 
- Which will be elaborated on in Rachana's part

## Conclusion

- Mexico has made significant progress in improving the quality of life for its population in recent decades. 
- Despite this, Mexico ranks low in the Better Life Index on many characteristics of happiness when compared to other countries. 
- In terms of income, jobs, education, health, environmental quality, social ties, safety, and life satisfaction, it falls short of the national average.
