## Developing an Unstructured Guide

Lofland and Lofland: Unstructured Interviews must be carefully thought out also.

Step 1: puzzlement phase articulate all the things about the research topic that are puzzling.

- Ask others what they find puzzling about the topic
- Consult books or articles about the topic

- Place probes: questions for respondent to think more critically provide more details from the last question

Weiss: questions should be developed during the interview

Create a warm and supportive 'talk' environment by

- Being an active listener
- Handle respondent silences well

### Active Listening in Research Data Collection
- Active listening is for these reasons:
	- Show interviewer are indeed listening to everything
	- Give respondent chance to correct misunderstandings
	    - Respondents and researchers can have historical, cultural, political, and philosophical differences
	- Can also be used to clarify respondent's answers
	- Can be used to keep respondents focused
- Active listening is done by supplying:
	- verbal mirror: To repeat the respondent's long answer into a concise statement confirming their meaning.
	- Probing: ask for further elaboration.
### Silences

You should never interrupt a respondent's silence 

Moments of silence in an interview should be appreciated as instances of thoughtful punctuation

Researchers should note down $\color{#693FA5}{\textsf{reason}\brace\textsf{length}}$ of silences

- Can be used to reference or better navigate sensitive matters
- Can be used as data to be analyzed

Interrupting silence could lose important information respondents might have said

- Respondents might feel its unimportant to say
- Respondents might have provided more details or moved to a new topic
