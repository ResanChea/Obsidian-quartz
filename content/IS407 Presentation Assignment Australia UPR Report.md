## Summary of stakeholder's submission for Australia in 2021

- 26 stakeholders submissions

- In this section, we will only look at some of the 90+ recommendations made by all the stakeholders in Australia. We will only discuss select concerns and recommendations most relevant and sensitive to Australia as our team already established.
- Firsty we will look at what the stakeholders all say about the rights of vulnerable groups in Australia.
- The first issue is the The rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people
	- the national human rights institution called the Australia Human Rights Commission or the AHRC called for the address of racial discrimination of the aboriginal among other racial groups in Australia.
	- The Joint Submission 1, which was a collection of comments from 202 of Australian NGOs, also recommended Australia to revise its constitution
		- to recognize the aboriginal & Torres Strait Islanders's rights
		- remove all racist elements
		- to include an anti-discrimination clause
	- !!! Are there reasons why aboriginals are overrepresented other than australia being bad?
- Secondly, we'll look at the recommendations for rights of persons with disabilities
	- The AHRC once again raise concern over the National Disability Strategy which was planned for 2010-2020. This project remain underfunded and made little progress in non-consensual sterilization of disabled people, low labour participation in the disabled, and how disabled people weren't able to stand trial.
	- The HRW furthered this point by reminding that Australia agreed, in its 2015 UPR, to improve the treatment of the disabled in its criminal justice system for mental and cognitive disabled people. There were little progress from this and even cases of violence from other inmates to the disabled and also difficult confinement conditions. The HRW recommends people with disabilities can't be held in solitary confinement
	- The LCA recommends eliminating discrinination and violence against the disabled and ensure equal opportunity to economic, social, and cultural rights. Meaning that the disabled should be able to get a job they are qualified for without discrimnation.
	- The JS1 similarly recommends inculsive education and end seclusion of children with disabilities.
- Asylum seekers and refugees are another group in this.
	- It is said that asylum seekers get detained without reason or time of release in prison like environments which could last months. The JS3, JS4 and other Joint Submissions called out negative changes in the formal criminal justice system that lengthen the processing and reject assistance to these groups. The JS1, HRW, HRFA, LCA, FMSI all recommends the reversal of this and address other issues such as child migrants and refoulment (or the sending of refugees back to their country of origin)
		- Shouldn't be able to hold asylum seekers for more than a period
	- 

- Why Australia keeps asylum seekers out
	- How many asylum seekers come to australia a year?
		- How many gets in?
		- 17,000 gets in a year
		- How many stays in detension centres
	- Is the NDS effective?
