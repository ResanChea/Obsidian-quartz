## fixed-but-adjustable exchange-rate system

is a system where the government give their own currency a fixed exchange rate

Managed Float: is when the market determine the exchange rate but the government still try to keep the rate at a reasonable level

exchange-rate stability on the one hand, and domestic economic
autonomy on the other.
