# I. What is an Argument?

An Argument is a group of two or more statements to prove something is right or wrong.


ðŸ—£ An Argument = Premises + Conclusion



## 1. Statements

Statements are sentences that can be viewed as either true or false.

- Statements can be either subjectively or objectively true or false.
- Statements can be a phrase or a clause
- Not all sentences are statements. (Questions, commands, proposals)

**Prefaces**: "It is true that [statement]."

Non statement won't make logical sense.


ðŸ’¡ Statements form Arguments



- What is not a Statement
    
    What time is it? (question) 
    
    Hi, Dad! (greeting)
    Close the window! (command) 
    
    Please send me your current catalog. (request) 
    
    Letâ€™s go to Paris for our anniversary. (proposal) 
    
    Insert tab A into slot B. (instruction) 
    
    Oh, my goodness! (exclamation)
    

## Rhetorical Question

Rhetorical Questions are used as a premise to assert something that is obvious to prove your conclusion.

## Ought Imperative

Ought Imperative is a statement given as a suggestion that can either be followed or not.

# II. Distinguish between Premises and Conclusions

## Premise Indicators

- since
- for
seeing that
- inasmuch as
because
- given that
- considering that
- as

## Conclusion Indicators

- therefor
- hence
- so
- it follows that
- that is why
- wherefore
- as a result

Sometimes there aren't indicators or doesn't act as indicators, so context is needed to see the meaning

- Find position Arthur is holding
- Conclusions are normally at the beginning or end of sentences
- Find Author's point or objective
- put indicators to see if it fit

# III. Non-Argument

## 1. Report

to give out information or to inform.

Reported Speech of another person's argument is not an argument itself.

ex: Government is legitimate, according to Hobbes, because living under a government is better than living in a state of nature. The advantages of government are so great that it is worth sacrifi cing some of our freedom in order to bring about these advantages.

## 2. Unsupported Assertions

to give out own belief, rational or irrational, true or false.

It is not an argument unless the author say the belief is supported by premises

ex: I believe that it is not dying that people are afraid of, We are afraid of never having lived...

## 3. Conditional Statements

if: Antecedent

then: consequent

if-then statements only assert that if one statement is true, the other must also be true. not to claim any of them will be true

ex: If Rhode Island were larger than Ohio, and Ohio were larger than Texas, then Rhode Island would be larger than Texas

Chain Arguments: multiple if-then arguments that link together

One or multiple conditional statements as premise

One conditional statement as a conclusion.

## 4. Illustrations

Illustrations are examples of the claim that are used to show not to prove a point or support the claim.

Illustrations can act as a premise, can be used in an argument.

### Problems with illustrations

- *for example* or *for instance* could be used to state an argument rather than an illustration
- illustrating a claim does not provide sufficient evidence to prove a claim true


ðŸ’¡ Principle of Charity: Unclear Passages should be interpreted as the stronger argument rather than the weaker. Bad arguments should be interpreted as a non-argument



## 5. Explanations

Explanations are used to prove why something is true rather than if it is true

- Past Events
- Well known general knowledge

explanandum: statement of what is being explained

explanans: statement of the explanation.

### Distinguish Arguments from Explanation

- The Common-Knowledge Test: if explanandum is common knowledge, it probably is an explanation
- The Past-Event Test  if explanandum is about past event it probably is an explanation
- The Authorâ€™s Intent Test: by looking at the statements, if it seems like the author is providing evidence to prove a claim is true, then itâ€™s an argument. If it seems like the author is offering an account of why something is true, then itâ€™s an explanation.
- The Principle of Charity Test

Sometimes the 4 tests still don't make it clear which it is

- if itâ€™s an argument, it is a good [bad] argument because _______.
- if itâ€™s an explanation, it is a good [bad] explanation because _______
