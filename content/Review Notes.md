IS303: Exam specification
The exam contains 3 parts. Total score=100, Part I and part II have 20 scores each part. Part III has 60 scores.
Part I and Part II: score will be generated automatically. Each student can do one time only using the RUPP team account in MS Team class. Any mistake in submission without an answer cannot be undone.

Part I. Understanding the concept (20 marks): this part contains 20 multiple choice questions covering all chapter ranking from scientific knowledge, causal analysis, and interview.

Part II. Applying concept (20 marks): this part contains 2 sections.
Section A. Will ask you to identify the nature of research whether it is quantitative or qualitative. You need just to fill in the word “Quantitative” or “Qualitative”. So you need to understand the nature of the differences between quantitative and qualitative.

Section B. Will ask you about the analytical methods based on the given statement. Three words will be provided: 1. Correlation 2.Compare mean T-test 3. Chi-square. You need to fill among the three to the statement that you think most appropriate. So you need to understand the different levels of measurement of the variables-Nominal, Ordinal, and Ratio, and the statistical test will be based on this type of measurement.

Part III. Research Practice (60 marks). Research interest is given to you and you will be asked to write down the unit of analysis, the research problem, objective, research question, identify variable and question and answer linking to the variables, sampling procedure, and finally the statistical tests that you think most appropriate to your identified variables.

NB: Part III: you need to write and submit in another exam section (you can write on hard paper then take a picture to upload or you write in soft copy then upload).

# Types of Variables

Quantitative:

represent amounts of things (e.g. the number of trees in a forest). Types of quantitative variables include:

- Ratio Variables: represent measures and can usually be divided into units smaller than one (e.g. 0.75 grams).
- Integer Variables: represent counts and usually can’t be divided into units smaller than one (e.g. 1 tree).

Qualitative:

represent groupings of things (e.g. the different tree species in a forest). Types of categorical variables include:

- **[Ordinal](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/ordinal-data/)**: represent data with an order (e.g. rankings).
- **[Nominal](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/nominal-data/)**: represent group names (e.g. brands or species names).
- **Binary**: represent data with a yes/no or 1/0 outcome (e.g. win or lose).

# Determine which test to use

ID: Independent Variable: Predictor Variable

DV: Dependent Variable: Outcome Variable

ID = Qual & DV = Qual ⇒ Chi-Square Test

ID = Qual & DV = Quan ⇒ Compare Means T-test

ID = Quan & DV = Qual ⇒ Correlation

ID = Quan & DV = Quan ⇒ Correlation

Correlation Test: used to measure the strength of the relationship between two variables

Compare Means T-Test: is used to compare the mean of a variable in one group to the mean of the same variable in one, or more, other groups.

Chi-Square Test: test to see if there is a relationship between two or more variables from different categories of the same population

# Unit of Analysis

---

Micro-theory: focus on individuals or small portions of society

- Individual: worker, student in college, member of the military
- Group: military families, fraternities, bowling teams

---

Meso-theory: focus on grand scale of whole state, large groups, etc.

- Formal Organization: Fortune 500 companies, universities, NGOs
- Geographical: distance, towns, terrain
- Policy Program: social security, austerity programs, drug treatment programs

---

Macro-theory: blend between both Micro and Macro

- Social Artifact: possessions of people or of society books, photos, newspapers
- social interactions: dynamic relations, divorces, arrests

---

# Sampling Procedures

- Nature of the questions: Quantitative or Qualitative
- Closed Ended or Open Ended Questions
