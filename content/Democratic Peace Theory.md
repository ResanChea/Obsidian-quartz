# Democratic Peace Theory [^1]

- First conceptualized by [[Woodrow Wilson\|Woodrow Wilson]] and usually applied with the [[Liberalism\|Liberalism]] governance style
- [Democratic peace theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_peace_theory): Democratic States don't go to war with one another

- factors are held as motivating peace between democratic states:

	- Democratic leaders are forced to accept responsibility for war losses to a voting public;
	- Publicly accountable statespeople are inclined to establish diplomatic institutions for resolving international tensions;
	- Democracies are not inclined to view countries with adjacent policy and governing doctrine as hostile;
	- Democracies tend to possess greater public wealth than other states, and therefore avoid war to preserve infrastructure and resources.

**Criticism:** Relations among democracies could be from the democratic US side of the Cold War bipolar world.
