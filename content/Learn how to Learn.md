- I should record lectures and go through them with pausing and looking up stuff in the text book to get a better understanding and more detailed information on the lecture I'm on
    - I feel like I don't understand much or that detailed about many topics that are presented in lectures, I will try and implement this into some of my classes
    - Record every lecture and upload in google drive for free
