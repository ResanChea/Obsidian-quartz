# What is the top down goal of this?

- [[Xi Jinping\|Xi Jinping]] wants to promote a 'more aggressive China'
- It was a retalitation to U.S.'s 'pivot to Asia'
- "China seeks to shape internationla norms and institutions and forcefully assert its pressence on the global stage"

    "wages go up and quality of life improves as low-skilled manufacturing rises, but countries struggle to then shift to producing higher-value goods and services"
    
- BRI projects are built using low-interest loans (not donations)
    - There are concerns China is targeting countries vulnerable to debt crises
    - overall debts to China has soared since 2013
    
- US's pivot to Asia includes Trans-Pacific Partnership (rejected), the BUILD act, USAID
    - But all of these are much less investments than China's $1 Trillion investment portfolio
