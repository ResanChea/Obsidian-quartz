# Unused Research Questions

Topic: The Republican-Liberal party divide and how it affects the effectiveness of US Foreign Policy.

- How does the polarization of governments and administration policy swings apply to other countries that have ineffective long term foreign policies?
- What happens after Biden's Administration?
- Using Foreing Policy theories what can be explain about this phenomenon?
- Find framework, indicator, variable to measure effectiveness of US FP
    - Can you prove how US parties are polarized
    - Domestic Actor Theory
    - The polarization was only applied to Trump, He's not a normal republican

---

1. Using Foreing Policy theories what can be explain about this phenomenon? [^7]
    - **Domestic Actor Theory** a change in which actors and/or institutions control the small state‚Äôs government leads to a change in foreign policy.
        - This change may occur because any or all of the following
            - A change in **control of the government** as different parties control key
            leadership positions (e.g. prime minister, president...)
            - A change in **domestic institutions** that lead to a change in the number of
            influence of veto players
            - A change in **power of non-governmental actors** to influence policy decisions (e.g. Ô¨Ç public opinion)
2. How is polarization in the US political system is affecting its foreign policy?
    - Once the Soviet Union collapsed and left the United States at the pinnacle of power, the need for national unity declined and ambitious politicians had less need to show restraint in attacking their political rivals without worrying too much about weakening the country. It is no accident that presidents have come to rely more and more on executive agreements rather than formal, ratified treaties: It has become increasingly difficult to get the latter through a divided Congress. Of equal concern is the possibility that other states will be wary of making mutually beneficial agreements with the United States, simply because they have no way to be sure whether an agreement reached this year will survive the next election. [^5]
3. Cases of this
    1. Obama to Trump switch:
        - Iran's Nuclear Deal [^3]
            - Signed in 2015 by Iran and several world powers, including the United States, the JCPOA placed significant restrictions on Iran‚Äôs nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.
            - President Trump withdrew the United States from the deal in 2018, claiming it failed to curtail Iran‚Äôs missile program and regional influence. Iran began ignoring limitations on its nuclear program a year later.
            - Washington and Tehran have both said they would return to the original deal but they disagree on the steps to get there.
                - In 2021, President Joe Biden said the United States will return to the deal if Iran comes back into compliance, though Iran‚Äôs leaders have insisted that Washington lift sanctions first.
        
        > ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs been happening is not that the administration is undoing President Obama‚Äôs legacy; it‚Äôs undoing American leadership on the international stage.‚Äù
        *- Former US National Security Adviser [^4]*
        > 
        - Obama‚Äôs focus on Asia-Pacific: pivot to asia
    2. Trump's decisions: leaving WHO, isolating from the international community [^1]
        - Exception: Biden supported Trump in: keeping protectionism/Trade-War against China, US withdrawal out of [[War in Afghanistan\|War in Afghanistan]]
        - What is left to change in Trump's foreign policy to Biden's?
    3. What will be continue from Trump to Biden administrative [^8]
        - In principle, Biden‚Äôs agenda is rooted in a repudiation of Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù legacy and the restoration of the multilateral order. [^6]
        - ‚ÄúBuy american‚Äù policies : continue the support on medicine and medical supplies from domestic manufacturers
        - Focus on china : putin on concessions on china state subsidies
        - What has been done?
            - followed through on Trump‚Äôs deal to withdraw from Afghanistan [^6]
            - Continue extension of new START treaty with Russia
            - Rejoin the Obama nuclear deal in Iran
