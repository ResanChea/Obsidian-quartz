- What is the definition of globalization?
    - Ritzer: globalization is characterized as the ‘flow’ of increasingly ‘liquid’ **units** such as humans, information, products, and the environment. [^2]
        - Units were solid before globalization
        - Also globalization: shift from ‘heavy to light’ of information, tools, people due to transportation technology. Organizations are more decentralized (Al-Qaeda) and more flexible.
    - Globalization can be defined as internationalization, liberalization, universalization, or as the supra-territorial/trans-planetary connection, which one depends on what is being discussed. (2008, Jan Aart Scholte) [^1]

        - Cycles: globalization rise, evolve, die out, and restart again in a cycle.
        - Phases: globalization evolved to it’s current state through 8 periods of bursts of development throughout history.
        - Events: globalization develops linearly through single events pushing it forward throughout history.
- What are the components of globalization?
- What are the sources of globalization? [^1] [^3]
    - Technology innovation: high-tech
        - compression of time and space: far distance transportation & communication

    - Law: Global law enforcement, arrests in different country than the crime
        - transnational crime, crime against humanity, terrorism, cyber crime,
- What are the security impacts of globalization?
    - Nuclear Weapon proliferation: nuclear states at 5 in 1968 to 9 now a days. States’ motivation for proliferating nuclear weapons can be [^4]
        1. The security model: States build nuclear weapons to increase **national security against foreign threats**, especially nuclear threats.
        2. The domestic politics model: States build nuclear weapons because these weapons **advance parochial domestic and bureaucratic interests**.
        3. The norms model: States build nuclear weapons because weapons acquisition, or restraint in weapons development, provides an important normative **symbol of a state's modernity or identity**.
        4. The psychology model: States build nuclear weapons because **political leaders** hold a **conception of their nation's identity** that leads them to desire the bomb.
        5. The political economy model: States build nuclear weapons because the nature of their **country's political economy-mostly interest**, whether or not it is globally integrated gives their leaders different incentives for or against having nuclear weapons.
        6. The strategic culture model: States build nuclear weapons because their strategic culture leads them to hold certain ideas about **how valuable** the acquisition and use of **nuclear weapons will be**.
    - Warfare:
    - The nature of war remains constant, but its form reflects the particular era and environment in which it occurs.
        - Which aspects of wars have changed: New or Post-Modern War
            1. New planes of warfare by Non-states warfare in 'new war theater'
                - Global media: contemporary wars are partly fought on television, and the media therefore have a powerful role in providing a framework of understanding for viewers of the conflict.
                - Cyberspace: hacking, disrupting communication
                - non-governmental organizations, intergovernmental organizations, regional and global media, users of the Internet, Terrorist operation
            2. Battlefield has now become 'Battlespace'
                - Airpower
                - Use of Space satellites
                - Cyberspace & communication
            3. Remotely piloted drones: non-human combatants
    - As the world is now interconnected, wars are hard and too costly to manage than just cooperating or solving arguments peacefully
- What are the positive impacts of globalization from security and socio-economic perspectives?
