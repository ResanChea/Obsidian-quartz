In the process of facilitating Cambodia and Thailand in resolving the border dispute, the United Nations has initialized a number of mechanisms to ensure a peaceful solution to the issue as well as 

Secondly, another mechanism that the United Nations has pushed for the border dispute is the concept of Preventive Diplomacy. Preventive Diplomacy is the general practice of seeking ceasefire between conflicting states to prevent further escalation of aggression, limit the spread of warfare, and maintain international peace and security. In the case of Cambodia and Thailand dispute, in 2011, along side Cambodia's request for ICJ reevaluation, the two country along with the Association of South East Asian Nations were present in a closed door meeting which concluded with a call for the two countries to begin a bilateral dialogue with one another to resolve the issue over the Hindu temple peacefully. A statement following the meeting stated, "The members of the Security Council further urged the parties to establish a permanent ceasefire and to implement it fully and resolve the situation peacefully and through effective dialogue," (CNN). The United Nations has also showed the respect of the regional organization to manage it's region's conflict as well. In Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the UN recognizes the right of regional organization to resolve issues before it is sent to the UN. In accordance with the Charter, the UN did involve the the chair of ASEAN as well as the association itself in dealings of the conflicts.

As the conflict was still not resolved, in 2013, the dispute was pushed forward for the United Nations themselves to deal with.
