# 2nd Sub-Conclusion

1. Inadequate medical capacity leads to loss of human capital and endanger vulnerable citizens.
    - Medical Capacity: Cambodia's heath care system is not equipped or ready to handle the patients if the pandemic is widespread.
        - Human Capital: Death of educated and productive work force.
        - Inequality: Poorer population don't have ability to test or get treatment.
        
        According to WHO country representative Li Ailan, the risk of a second wave remains and much more preparation is needed. "They're still in the early stage," she said. "If there was a large scale outbreak, the system could be overwhelmed."
        

As Cambodia has an economy that relies on export and tourism, the country's economy won't recover until China, Europe, and the United States return to normal. Meaning that they accept our exports and start traveling again, so we receive our tourism back. In light of the inevitable economic downturn, the country should use the time to focus on improving it's medical capacity. The insufficiency of Cambodia's medical sector, if the coronavirus cases surge, will cause catastrophic impacts on the citizens. Firstly, due to the lack of healthcare facilities and professionals, not all Cambodians will get treatment and will lead to the overwhelm of the health facilities. This will lead to widespread death that will also affect the economy. In addition to that, it will lead to inequality in testing and treatment as the rich will more likely be prioritized over the poor. Therefore, in the current state of Cambodia's medical sector, a risk of a second wave that will undoubtedly overwhelm the country's capacity is too big of a gamble to take.
