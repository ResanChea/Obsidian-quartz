1. Core assumptions of realism
- State is the main actors, which means that everything they do is for the sake of national interest. They primarily rely on themselves in the anarchic world.
- In order to survive, they rely on balance of power and deterrence.
- There is no international authority, while the norms and laws are few and ineffective
- Cooperation is not impossible, but there is few incentive for states to international arrangement, but the IGOs have no enforcement power
- NGOs and MNCs have no influence to states’ behavior
2. Neoliberal institutionalism or neoliberalism explain international cooperation as an anarchic world but rational states choose to cooperate with each other with the help of international organization. And international organization role is to help solve problem that one state cannot solve, moderate state behavior, provide guarantee framework for interaction, a context for bargaining provide mechanism for reducing cheating by monitoring behavior, punishing wrong states, and facilitate transparency.

> The Prisoner's Dilemma Two prisoners are interrogated separately for a crime
> 
- If one confess and the other didn't, the one who confess go free, the silent one takes long sentence
- If both confesses they both get reduced sentences
- If neither confess, they receive short sentences

> Without communication, they will both confess, making a bad sentenceWith communication, they will agree to keep quiet to get short sentencesThe self-serving bias of each player will lead to bad outcome for both players.Therefore, states communicating and cooperating, looking for mutual interests is more beneficial in the long term.
> 

States choose continuous interactions with each other because they know they will interact with the same actors in the future.
