Dear

Hi! I wanted to start off by asking if you and your family are doing well and what the COVID-19 situation is in your country. In my village, there are only Khmer people, who all work in rice fields for a living. Since the Coronavirus cases in my village are slowing down, I can go back to school now, which makes me very happy. My family and I have taken the vaccine. While I have taken two doses myself. I think that our health is very important, therefore we all should be wearing masks. In my village, it can get very hot and very cold sometimes. Currently, it is getting close to harvesting the season, and my family and my community are preparing for the upcoming harvest.
