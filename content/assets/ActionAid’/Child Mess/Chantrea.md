Dear ___

Greetings! I would like to translate this message from Chantrea to you. She wanted to start off by saying “I spend most of my time studying. But aside from that, I also help with house works such as cooking rice, washing the dishes, and caring for my younger siblings. When free from all those, I practice and memorize my older lessons.”. On another topic though, Chantrea mentioned “In my community there has been cases of COVID-19, since they do not practice enough proper safety precautions during these times.”. “For me though, my family, myself, and my siblings always wear a mask and cleans our hands with alcohol.”. She added that “Nevertheless, in my village, people still worry that they will contract this virus and do try to protect themselves.”. She went on to say that her school is now reopened. The studying schedule is alternating between morning and afternoon. She expressed that “I am very happy once I can start studying again like this”. Lastly, she said “I wish for my sponsor good health!”.
