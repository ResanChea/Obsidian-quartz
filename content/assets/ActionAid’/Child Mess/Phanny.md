My family and I are doing well. My family does not farm a rice field like many others, but we fish in the Tonle Sap river for a living. We make our food from our catching with vegetables and meats from the market. The Rural Friend Community Development Organization (RFCD) has taught my community members many things as well as provide us with supplies such as snacks to lift our spirits, books, pens, pencils, rulers, bags, soap, toothpaste, and toothbrushes. If the Coronavirus crisis were to end, I would like to go out and play in the waterfall of L’aeang J’rork with my parents and siblings. I felt very happy when I had taken the vaccine. Afterwards, I know it does not protect me 100%. We still have to continue protecting ourselves as always. Lastly, I want to thank you and I bless you with good health.
