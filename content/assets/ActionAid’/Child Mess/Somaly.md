Greetings from Cambodia

Dear ___

Hello, generous sponsor! I would now interpret and translate this message from Somaly to you. She started off the letter by explaining her daily life by saying “Whenever I get the chance or have free time off from studying, I help my mother with cooking rice and washing the vegetables.”. She explained that her community does not have any COVID-19 cases since they all have had their vaccine injections. Somaly explained that she knew the right things to do during these times, saying “We must wear protective masks, maintain distance, and stay away from crowds.”. She said further that “Nowadays, my village is conducting funerals and weddings with joy and laughter.” She continued “However, we still obey safety rules by all wearing masks and cleaning with alcohol as always.”. Lastly, she wants to inform you that “Me and my family is doing well. How about yourself?”.
