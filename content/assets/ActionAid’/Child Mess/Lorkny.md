Dear

Greetings, my family and I are in good health and I want to ask how you are as well. My parents, siblings, and the rest of my town are shielded from COVID by a vaccine. I know that if I get large symptoms after taking the vaccine, I would need to go to a health facility and for a doctor to checkup. However, my family did not get many symptoms at all. After being vaccinated, I think we should still wash our hands
