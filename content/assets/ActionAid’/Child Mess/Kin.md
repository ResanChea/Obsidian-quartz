With loves from Cambodia

Greetings! I want to tell you that my family and I are doing great! We all have already taken the COVID-19 vaccine. ActionAid and BCV have helped my community tremendously in raising chickens, growing vegetables, and saving group We, as a community, have changed dramatically as we are informed about the importance of vaccines against diseases from chickens, the process of producing natural animal feedings, compost fertilizer, and natural pesticides. In the future, I want to be a police officer! I remember the drawings I sent to you the most because of the amount of effort I put in. In this child sponsorship program, I remember fondly the events in which my friends and I played such as jumping rubber band, pumping water in bottles, and trivial questions for prize money. I think you are very valuable to my family and community since you changed our livelihood dramatically for the better. Finally, I want to give you all my good wishes and ask for you and your family to keep safe from this deadly disease. Thank you.

With loves
