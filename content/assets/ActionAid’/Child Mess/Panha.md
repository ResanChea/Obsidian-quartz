I will interpret and translate this message for Panha. Ever since COVID-19 affected the world, Panha’s village is also affected by this. He started off by informing that his family is happy and healthy and that every one of his family members are fully vaccinated. He went on to explain that “After getting the vaccine injection, I did not get any bad symptoms at all!”. “My family has been very joyous since they have access to such protective measures” Panha continued “Furthermore, most people in my whole community are able to get the vaccine as well”. He went on to elaborate that “I know other than getting the vaccine, I should wear protective masks, use alcohol sanitizers, and social distance.”. “My school has been closed down 3 times so far and whenever it closes, I study online through a phone while taking notes on my notebook.” He said. He continued “My school is now open again but we only study 4 hours a day and with a class of only 15 people each to maintain safety.”. Panha says he is in grade 2 so far and mentioned that “When I first started class once again, I helped my classmates clean up the class.”. He finished by saying “I was very glad to meet my teachers and friends once again.”. Finally he wanted to inform you that “I wish you the very best and for your great health as well!”.
