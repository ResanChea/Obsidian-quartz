Dear ___

Me and my family is doing well and have all taken the COVID-19 vaccine. Although, after taking the vaccine, I didn’t feel any symptoms and am doing good. I feel happy that I am well protected against this virus as my whole community has also taken the vaccine.  On top of that, I think everyone should be wearing a protective mask, use alcohol sanitizers, and social distance to not contract the Coronavirus. On the other side, my school has closed down two times since the COVID-19 outbreaks started. When that happens, I have to study through a phone while writing on my notebook. However, class has now started once again and I only study 2 hours a day with a classroom of 32 students. I am very happy that I get to meet my teacher again. I have now reached grade 4. When I first started school, I had to sweep the class as an obligation. I want to thank you for your generous contributions and I wish you great health.

Sincerely,

Sovannphum

This is my last message. I just want to say, your contributions have helped me and my community greatly and I wish you
