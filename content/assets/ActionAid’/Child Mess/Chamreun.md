Greetings from Cambodia

Dear

Hello! my dear sponsor. My family and I are doing well. How about your family? Are they well and happy as well?

Currently, my public school called ‘Likom’ has not reopened for schooling yet because of the problem of COVID-19. It has spread throughout my country. However, if schools were to reopen for me to study, I would be very much happy as I would be able to meet up with my friends once again. Before I go to school though, I would prepare food, water, hand sanitizers, and masks with me to protect myself against the Coronavirus in the school. Furthermore, my teachers have introduced me and all other students to the processes of maintaining hygiene such as frequently washing our hands with soap, clean water, sanitizing gel and alcohol, and maintaining social distance. Our teachers also prepared for their students some supplies such as soap, freshwater, alcohol, and gel to clean their hands. Other than washing our hands at school, at home or when I go out, I still always remain safe with these methods because there can be many people entering and leaving my home. Finally, I want to wish you, our sponsor, to do a quick and safe recovery from COVID-19 and any other disease.
