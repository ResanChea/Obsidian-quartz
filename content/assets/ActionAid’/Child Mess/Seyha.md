Dear sponsor

Hello, I would like to translate this message from Seyha for you. He began by informing that “My family and I are doing well and happy. How are you and your family doing yourself?”. He said further that “Nowadays, my school has opened for students again, right after COVID-19 cases started to slow down. This makes me very happy since I get to meet my friends again.”. Piseth added “Before I go to school every day though, I prepare food, water, surgical masks, and alcohol sanitizers to protect myself and people around me from catching COVID.”. “My Teachers has informed all of us students to always maintain cleanliness. They also supplied us with soap, gel, and alcohol at school as well to clean our hands.” Piseth said. He also mentioned that “Whenever I am home, or go outside, I always remain clean and safe and do the same as at school to contribute to stopping the deadly Coronavirus from spreading further in my village.”. To conclude, he asked “Is the Coronavirus situation in your area slowing down or lifting? Furthermore, how is the weather there? How do you go out to eat in this situation?”. Finally, he said “I wish you good health and for you to face only success wherever you go!”.
