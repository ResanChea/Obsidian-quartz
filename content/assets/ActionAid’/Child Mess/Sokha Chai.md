Dear

Hello, Iâ€™m very glad to talk to you again. I wish for you to have good health and get happiness wherever you go. For me, Like many schools in Cambodia, it has shut down due to the outbreak of Coronavirus.  I felt so happy when I knew the school closed. Whenever I go to school, though, I always wear a mask, have alcohol and sanitizing gel ready, and wash my hands in every break session I get in school. Before I go to school, I shower and wash myself thoroughly in preparation for studying. My teachers have been advising me how to keep ourselves clean and for every student to keep vigilant in washing our hands and wearing a mask around others. This has helped me and my family stay free from the COVID-19 virus. To you, our sponsor, I want to ask, in your country, are you and your family doing good and well? What is the weather like at your place? Finally, I want to thank you again for your contributions to my family and community in helping us escape from this deadly and widespread Coronavirus.
