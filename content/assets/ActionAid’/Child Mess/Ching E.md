Dear

Hello generous donator, I want to inform you that my town as well as my family and me are doing great since everyone has taken the Coronavirus vaccine injections. I feel very lucky to have access to the vaccines to protect my friends and family from this deadly virus. Ever since I got the vaccine injection, I have been doing great and feel that I am healthy. Other than taking the vaccine, me and my family have been taking precautions to protect ourselves such as socially distance, using hand sanitizers, as well as wearing surgical masks. Recently, I have been studying at home with my mother’s help through a cell phone, but without problem, because my school has closed down for the third time. Nowadays, my school has opened up and they allow 4 hour school days and my class has 30 students which are distanced away from each other. I now study in grade 1 and am very happy to be able to meet my teacher and friends once again. I want to give many thanks to our donator who helped me and my community in many ways.

With love,

Ching E. 

In the beginning of school I had the duty of sweeping the floors just as every student also had to do.
