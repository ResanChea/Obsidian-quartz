Hello my sponsor, How are you doing? All my family members including me have taken the COVID-19 vaccine. Not one of us is without it and we are doing very well. We are very happy to be protected by this vaccine, just like the rest of our community are. Even after getting the injection, we still have to practice 3 Do(s) and 3 Don’t(s). Do wash your hands, wear masks, and social distance. Don’t get crowded, go in enclosed spaces, or shake hands. I do stick by those rules and try my best to protect myself. Furthermore, I have been helping my family with work as well. Finally, I wish best of wishes to you, our sponsor, and that you and your family stay safe, happy, and get wealthy.
