Dear

Nice to meet you again my sponsor. There has been vaccination operations fighting COVID-19 to each towns, including mine. Therefore, My family is doing fine and well since all of my family has taken the Coronavirus vaccine. Since taking the vaccine though, I have not been feeling of its bad side effects at all. To be honest, my family and I are very happy to have taken the vaccine. We are protected even more since the rest of my community has taken the vaccine injections as well. In addition, we know that the vaccine will not protect us fully. So I, along with others, still practice safety measures such as wearing surgical masks, using hand sanitizers, as well as social distance. On the other side, my school has been shut down 3 times by this point. As a result, I needed to study online as I note down on my notebooks. Recently, my school has reopened. We are only allowed to study for 4 hours a day with 25 students per class. I’ve recently reached the 4th grade and have been very happy to meet my friends and teachers once again. Finally, I would like to thank my sponsor for your contribution and wish you good health!
