Dear

I am pleased to be translating this message from Kakada to you, our sponsor. He started the letter off by describing his current situation by saying “My village consists of both Khmer and Islam people, who live in harmony through trading and factory work on the sea.”. He continued “My family is in normal condition and are happy that we are safe.”. Kakada began to describe his crops and food by saying “I really like planting mangos and watermelons.”. He added “I get fresh water for vegetables such as cucumbers, carrots, and peper.”. “I also use it to water my edible fruits such as durians, apples, and grapes”. Kakada wants to inform you that he, his family, as well as community has taken the COVID-19 vaccine twice already at the Sonya hospital. He elaborated that “I really think that our health is very important. We should exercise, wash our hands with soap and alcohol”. He ended by saying “The weather here is very cold and windy. We are also in the process of collecting our rice yield and replant for the next season.”.
