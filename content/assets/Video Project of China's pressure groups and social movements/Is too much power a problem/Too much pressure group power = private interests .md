# Too much pressure group power => private interests running government(interest group=private interest)groups have rights to demand but should not demand too much

Too little (Government): Too little in autocratic government that pays insufficient attention to legitimate citizen demands.
â€¢ Government give rights to citizen to their input and output roles but should not be too carefree, should also have some restriction when necessity otherwise more groups come to demand => chaos
