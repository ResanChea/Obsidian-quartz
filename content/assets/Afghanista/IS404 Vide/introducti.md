ðŸ“Œ **INTERIM GOVERNMENT â€”** an emergency government or transitional government that was set up for the period before the countryâ€™s first free election

</aside>

Greeting to all viewers. We are from group 2 and our groupâ€™s video will be talking about the issue of the Afghanistan conflict, specifically the consequences of the Talibanâ€™s extreme ideology on the International Community. 

[clip 14, pic 4 & pic 5] Before we begin, we must know that the conservative political and religious faction that emerged in Afghanistan revolves around the involvement of the Taliban group that came to seize control over the capital, Kabul, after the disturbance and displacement during the Afghan War from 1978 to 1992. 

[clip 12] After the long effort of fighting against the Afghan government, the Taliban finally took control of Afghanistan for 5 years where they practiced brutal Islamic Law. 

[clip 2] During that time, the constitution of human rights was ripped off by this group; music and television were banned, girls were forbidden from going to school, men and women were stoned to death for adultery. 

[clip 10 & clip 11] The regime neglected social services and other basic state functions, for instance, the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice required women to wear the head-to-toe burqa or chadri; and even to the extent that they would jail men whose beards it deemed too short

[clip 8] although the cruelty of the Taliban continues, the world, however, doesnâ€™t show any support towards its action. Even after the US troops overthrew the Taliban when they invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, the country did not achieve peace to its fullest, however, the damage is less traumatizing than when the Taliban is present. 

[clip 7] Pivot back to the recent event, after 20 years of battle against the US-led coalition, in April 2021, the Biden administration has decided to withdraw its troops from all military bases located in Afghanistan. 

[clip 5] As a result of the protection withdrawal from both the US and Afghan leader, the Taliban has once again expanded its influence through militia power and took over the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul. 

[pic3 & p.i.p] They had announced the all-male interim Taliban government that entails only the senior Taliban members in the line of duty. 

[pic1 & p.i.p] In contrast to the 1990s, a recent Taliban spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has reassured that they would have a peaceful transfer of power, that it would offer amnesty to government officials, and that womenâ€™s rights would be respected.  

[â€™1] 5:39 - 5:55 

[pic2 & p.i.p] Although this may sound promising, sources from Afghanistan have said that most of the things the Taliban government had said werenâ€™t exactly what is put in practice in reality. 

[clip 6] 

[clip 9 & clip 13] The reality of Afghanistan, unfortunately, is still under their interpretation of law and order, where the Taliban insert the exclusion of women from public life (including employment and education), the systematic security destruction, and the implementation of harsh criminal punishments, like hanging the thief as a punishment in public. 

[clip 4] The ambiguity of what the government of Taliban is planning to do remains unsolved, and as time flies by, the people continue to suffer under the violence of the Taliban, the restriction of diplomatic and civilâ€™s rights, as well as, the economic downfall of the country due to its unfulfilling promises and actions. 

[clip 15] The objectives of this video are to analyze the Taliban projection towards becoming a legitimate government of Afghanistan and take notice of the conflict mechanisms that had been used before based on the theories we had learned about conflict resolution management.
