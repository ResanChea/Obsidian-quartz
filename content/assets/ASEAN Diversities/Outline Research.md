#ASEAN Decision Making Mechanism
The 'ASEAN Way' is a informal and sovereignty-centered resgional policy-making processes.

- Soverignty Rights + Seeking of Consensus makes the organization powerless when the decision might affect any member negatively.

#Economic Diversity
The first weakness often occurs because a large gap between CLMV (Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), Myanmar, Vietnam) and the ASEAN Six (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines).

To be independent, rather than depending on external powers, it is paramount for the ASEAN Six to economically assist CLMV, or else the latter follows the political-economic strategies and orientations of outside powers.

Although consensus building within ASEAN comes more naturally by focusing on similarities and recurring patterns, the ASEAN approach needs to address, rather than ignore, their gap and strive to meet their differences through similarities.
