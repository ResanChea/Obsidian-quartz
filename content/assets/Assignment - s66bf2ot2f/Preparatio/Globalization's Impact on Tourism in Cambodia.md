        - Water shortage â€“ It is very evident that the tourism industry overuses the water resources for the development of golf courses, swimming pools, hotels, and even the personal use of water by some tourists. [^2]
        - effects on indigenous peoples have been profound: wide-scale eviction from their lands; economic dislocation; a breakdown of traditional values; environmental degradation; and commodification of culture, including degradation of cultural sites when historic sites and buildings are demolished to make way for tourist facilities [^6]
