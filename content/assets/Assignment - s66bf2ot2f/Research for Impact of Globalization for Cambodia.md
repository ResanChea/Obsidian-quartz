> The private sector is working closely with the government to newly brand and market Cambodia (as a mono destination) and encourage tourists to spent 10 days or two weeks here (as opposed to being a destination in a multi-destination itinerary).

> Ministry of Tourism about allowing vaccinated travellers in with minimal or no quarantine.
> 

> We are also requesting that the government creates a fund as soon as possible that will go towards retraining and refreshing the skills of previous tourism employees who have left the sector. Most of them wanted to remain in the hospitality sector, but have been away for more than a year now working in the agriculture and construction sectors as there is still work to be found there.

> The 38 Roads project has started in Siem Reap. The project comprises huge infrastructure improvements that are being carried out while no tourists are there. There is also a lot of effort being put into developing eco-tourism and new experiences related to that.

> Contributing over 70% of jobs and 58% of GDP in 2018, Cambodia’s micro-, small and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) have been profoundly affected by the pandemic. The tourism industry, Cambodia’s second-largest driver of economic growth and where many MSMEs work, is especially in crisis. In 2019, tourism generated about US$4.9 billion, nearly 20% of the country’s GDP, while COVID-affected 2020 saw international tourism revenue plummet nearly 80%, to US$1.023 billion.
> 

> 99% had been affected by the pandemic and lockdowns, with over 50% severely affected in April 2021. As COVID-19 restrictions were extended, the situation worsened: 54% of respondents reported cash flow problems in November 2020, increasing to 83% by April 2021.
> 

> by April 2021, facing greater restrictions and a worsening public health crisis, 33% of Cambodian tourism businesses reported having laid off employees – twice as many as in November.
> 

> Idled tourism workers sought any short-term work opportunities to make ends meet. In Siem Reap, the gateway to Angkor Wat and other attractions, many women – who were disproportionately affected by layoffs – left the city, hoping to find jobs in the garment industry in Phnom Penh. Unfortunately, COVID-19 containment measures caused the garment factories to close.
> 

> Many Cambodian tourism MSMEs were unable to adapt their business models to digital methods.
> 

> However, online is not an option for tourism businesses that cannot offer takeout food or virtual services.
> 

> Cambodia has provided direct support, such as cash for laid-off workers, and indirect support, such as debt restructuring. Unregistered businesses do not currently qualify for support, yet they make up a large share of employers and workers.

> The initial optimism of many Southeast Asian MSMEs for a 2021 economic recovery has been dampened by the latest wave of COVID-19. Despite this, Cambodia may see a quicker return to normal due to one of the highest vaccination rates in the region.
