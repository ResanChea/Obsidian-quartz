> 
- The United States of America would strongly support clause 7 because we believe in the effectiveness of actions like smart sanctions and arms embargo that will produce effective actions from the government of Burma. The United Nations must keep pressure on the military junta to stop their violations against human rights and restore the democraticaly elected government legitimately elected late last year. Resan
    - If others want to remove arm embargo: US will try to have middle ground with replacing arms embargo with smart sanctions
        - It’s one of the only thing the international community can do without violating any country’s sovereignty.
- Argument: arms embargo is not effective to stop military.
