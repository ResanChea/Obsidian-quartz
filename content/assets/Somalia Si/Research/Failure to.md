Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-2NvPfl0l4&ab_channel=DWNews

Since Feb 2021, president's term ended

# Reasons why no election

- The election venues in Jubeland doesn't exist, doesn't have access for people in Jubeland to vote
    - unless federation troops are pulled out?
- Jubeland has no mechanism to handle election
- biased composition of election commission: current president's allies
- Opposition party says that president is an obstacle to election
    - need transition of national council headed by speaker of parliament, senate, member of opposition, civil society or election might never happen under the president
    - not sure if council will be formed
