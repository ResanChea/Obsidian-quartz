# Draft 1

[[12th-FiveYearPlan_062811.pdf.pdf]]

- According to the (China Daily), by 2012 there are about half a million so called NGOs operating in China.
- I say so called because a very small amount of those NGOs are actually non governmental.
    - Most NGOs in China are Government-Operated Nongovernmental Organizations.
        - They are created by, funded by, staffed by, and controled by the government in China.
    - The minority of actual non governmental organizations are advocacy groups divided into three specific interest groups, professional groups, and citizens' groups and are not directly funded by the state.
        - However, they are still very restricted by the government and only allowed access to "operational autonomy".
            - Do they also receive inconsistent funding from the state?
            - Is that a reason for NGOs to stay in line with government. Same as GONGOs?
        - The government give autonomy and some times influence in decision making in exchange for their social services of education, health care, infrastructure, and social security programs.
- These advocacy groups have to choose their fields of operation very carefully.
    - For reasons explained before, sensitive issues relating to human rights, politics, and ___ are off limits.
        - (maybe show visuals from rya's part to demonstrate repetition to jog memory)
        - maybe find more fields to make the point clear of what is off limits
    - Most NGOs operate in non-sensitive and non-political areas such as
        - environment, public health, education, services for the disabled and elderly, children, poverty alleviation
        - show tiny clips of each field while i list them
        - These non-sensitive societal issues are inherently encouraged by the government.
            - For them to take part in providing social services in assistance of China's government.
    - The reason for this difference of operational power between the GONGOs and Grassroots NGOs might be for a few reasons
        - visual bubbles of how big difference they are
        - GONGOs were a big topic of scholarly interests in 1990s
            - Probably need research
        - While NGOs only emerged in the early 2000s with the rise of the internet in China
            - They also are restricted to provide social services to communities instead of any political issues
        - On top of that, social grassroots groups in China is expected to meet multiple hefty requirements to become actual NGOs in China
            - They must put a down payment of 30,000 yuan ($4,500)
            - They must have a supervisory agency connected to the government, which is quite impossible due to the risk vs benefits that these agencies get from bringing a new NGO under its wing.
            - Therefore "NGOs" operate at a gray zone as businesses instead, and risking declared illegal anytime.
                - Use video of paper highlights to demonstrate
                
                ([Sage Journals)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2158244017713554)
                

- It seems that the China's transition from a centralized market to a free market made social and interest groups gain more influence and put pressure on the CCP on both economic policies and political decisions.
    - So what's in store for the future of interest groups in China
        - Well according to Jing Yuejin from the Department of Political Science of the Tsinghua University of China, he puts it better than I can
            - Put short video of his actual slides scrolling
        - For the Chinese social-governmental structure and relations to remain stable in the future it must
            1. First, deliberative management and control of all social organizations of all social organizations
            2. Second, By the CCP adjecting important public policies and revising laws concerning its citizen's well beings
                - This is already underway, as in 2006 China abolished its agricultural land tax that has been a burden to Chinese farmers for thousands of years.
                    - Show paper with highlights

                - In 2001, China also passed a labor rights law that allowed workers unions to exist for the first time.
                    - Show paper with highlights

            3. Third, China must be switch over from a GDP based targets for its economy into a more inclusive development strategy that does not leave marginalized people in society behind.
                - And this point has also been in progress by China as well in its 12th iteration of its five year plans for the country in 2011.
                    - The plan aimed the country to improve the overall citizen's wages and to provide better education opportunities and healthcare.
                    - It also for the first time set less numerical production targets, instead relying on the production from market mechanism with the support of the government
                - Show paper with multiple highlights switching focus and zooming according to what i'm talking about
            4. Fourth, the government should improve the social welfare gradually
                - Trying to reduce the huge wealth and influence gap between the rich and the poor would stick to its traditional equality values but also improve the problem of interest groups inequality where capitalists and resourceful interest groups garnering the larger voice in society
            5. The Chinese governments could improve the policy making process.
                - To enhance the quality of decision makings in a democratic and scientific way by including the participation of both the relevant experts and the general public
                    - Either it through uncensored public discussions of hot topics or through the media
            6. And lastly the CCP could be a service-oriented government, where leadership act by providing services, funding, and protection among groups in society rather than take on a dictatorial-ship role.

It seems that China has been heading in the right direction of adopting more liberalized social groups systems due to the rapid inflow of capitalist economic growth. However, it is still uncertain of what the future would actually look like.
