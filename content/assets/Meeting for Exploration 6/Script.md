- Then use that to introduce the audience to your topic

1. Use a contrarian approach

propose a common topic, but go against the normal answer. then explain your perspective after.

- unexpected view

Ex: What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

2. Ask a series of rhetorical questions

questions not expected to be answered but to make you curious, to think of what the point the presenter is getting at

3. Deliver a compelling sound bite (quotes)

historian, famous people's sayings, related to your point.

# Tension

- Journey in looking into the topic
    - How'd you begin to think this way?
- Was there anything unexpected you found.
