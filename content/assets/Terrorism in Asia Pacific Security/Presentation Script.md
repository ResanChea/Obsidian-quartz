And doing audits and inspection against these DDOS attacks are very costly to upkeep. Asia-Pacific as a region has no real plan for tackling this problem together. As for consumer's personal information, people tend to be careless on how they protect their private information which are valuable to advertising companies and easily exploited by hackers.
