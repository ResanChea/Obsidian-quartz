# Policy Recommendations

1. In the past Asia-Pacific has faced issues of slow response due to the disagreement over whether each cases of transnational crime is considered to be state or regional security. Therefore, Asia-Pacific should establish regional standard of what is considered terrorism and what the appropriate response should be, to allow for agreement and urgent response to crisis.
2. As can be seen earlier, Asia-Pacific does not have a central persistent institution to respond to such issues as terrorism, cyber security attacks, and human trafficking. Transnational crimes continue to generate billions of dollars and the issue will still be present unless there are cooperative response in a serious manner. Therefore, the region of Asia-Pacific requires a more reliable international institution that holds binding power over its members to specifically address these problems.
3. As developing countries in Asia-Pacific have limited resources in building their nation's security, they often neglect or lack the capacity to deal with non-traditional security issues that can impact them directly later on. In turn, developed countries should provide technology transfer and expertise for developing countries to deal with these transnational issues on their own effectively.

# Reference and Analysis

- ASEAN & ASEAN+3 deals with human trafficking...
    - doesn't have standardized norm for dealing with transnational issues
        - country of origin must be instigator
    - ASEAN is the forefront in addressing these issues
        - Singapore
    - Voluntary agreements aren't effective
        - Sharing info, data, building confidence (too soft)
        - ASEAN/Asian value
        - breach of sovereignty
- APEC
- Countries profit from human trafficking sex tourism
    - less incentive to cooperate
- Asian countries don't have capacities to deal with transnational issues
    - technology transfers
    - no extradition treaty (Capture and return foreign prisoners)
- terrorism

To recognize transnational crimes (human trafficking...) as a real issue to national/regional security

- Establishment of international standard of what is considered a threat (define)
    - What is terrorism
    - What is the appropriate response
- Differentiate national vs regional threat

There should be a permanent institution or a multilateral treaty in Asia-Pacific that is directly responsive to transnational crimes with binding binding power over its members.

- coersive action
- quick to action
- have limited consequential power over member states
