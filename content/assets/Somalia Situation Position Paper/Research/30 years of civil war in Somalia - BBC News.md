Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FY96qD_W1k&ab_channel=BBCNews

2021: The country's been destroyed institutionally and need many more years to rebuild

There are clans fighting each other for election

- Each clan have their own candidate in mind to win the election

The government is fighting the militant group of Al-Shibab

The United States might be there to defend the democracitc election??

The comment sections says the BBC was biased in showing the bad sides of Somalia but not look at its progress or potential?
