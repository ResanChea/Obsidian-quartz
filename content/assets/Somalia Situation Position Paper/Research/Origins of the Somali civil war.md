Area called "Greater Somalia"

- Leads to future conflicts

President got assasinated and military coup happened 

Barre: set up society with communist values

- Collective industry work
- Got help from Egypt and Soviet

## Attack against Ethiopia

Military rose up in power and began invading Ethiopia

- Occupied 80% of what would make "Greater Somalia"
