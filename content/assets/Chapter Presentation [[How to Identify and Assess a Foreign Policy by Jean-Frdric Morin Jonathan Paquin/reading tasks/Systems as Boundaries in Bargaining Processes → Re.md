# Systems as Boundaries in Bargaining Processes → Regulators: Law, Procedures, and Diplomatic Norms and Values

**Systems as Boundaries in Bargaining Processes**

The structure and dependencies of the international system create obstacles and

opportunities in bargaining across borders. Intergovernmental and non-governmental

organizations, states as well as regions, political parties and private sector companies will limit and enhance the opportunity for successful negotiation processes.

Of course, if the international organization is weak, it will be less successful than if it carries supranational authority. In other words, the more interdependency between states, the more an effective negotiation process is needed, and the stronger the international fabric has to be.

Political reality, however, cannot be overlooked. Powerful countries cannot easily be

constrained within the limits of international regimes. Yet international regimes do have an important function in channelling bargaining processes in such a way that their efficiency and effectiveness will be optimized. Without these organizational boundaries, there can be no effective processes, but these limitations also, of course, might have negative effects, such as inflexibility through over-bureaucracy

**Needs: the role of interests and positions**

Parties take positions connected to their needs. The negotiation problem is the fruit of the situation into which it has been born. Without changing that context, the problem cannot be solved through bargaining, as it will always pop up again until external incentives change its environment.

Experience in training diplomats and civil servants, suggest that the perception of negotiating parties on process, procedures, positions, power and products (in the sense of agreements) is indeed important. Perception determines reality. In some cultures, perceptions are important but are open to nuance and change, for example through neutral media. In others, perceptions are inflexible and static. People might be used to haggling and therefore would not hesitate to use distributive bargaining (and indeed may actually enjoy it), while others are accustomed to fixed prices and do not like the risk of the give and take. It should be noted here, however, that flexibility in market haggling does not necessarily mean having an open mind-set on negotiation processes between states. To the contrary, the reverse situation has been observed: the majority of young diplomats from ‘haggling cultures’ have a tendency to be very positional/inflexible in inter-state bargaining. Those from cultures where horsetrading is not part of day-to-day life, and where approaches to negotiation are more rational and less emotional, will be inclined to be more relaxed in inter-state processes.
