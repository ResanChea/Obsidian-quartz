# Introduction

We had learned about the aspects of dealing with diplomatic negotiations, in this chapter, we will try to understand more regarding the context of the negotiation process, as well as its function in enhancing the utility of diplomatic negotiation in comparison to other kinds of instruments in conflict resolution. 

But in order to understand a negotiation process, we need to understand the context of the issues by questioning the "what happens" "why it happened" and "when did it happen", then thereby optimizing the effectiveness of the policy that we called "negotiation"

Now, one might think that we might be able to understand the context of the issue and find a solution to tackle its weakness by studying the state's actors. However, it is much more complex than that. And for one reason, it is because the more unstructured the opponents, the more difficult they are to control. 

For example: to chase the Taliban out of Kabul has not been too difficult, but it circled back to the question that who will be the winner in Afghanistan in the end. To win a conventional war in Iraq was not much of a problem, but the problem is trying to restore the country's structure after it broke down. 

However, rather than thinking solely about the end-stage of the issue will be, we must also focus on the process of dealing with it as well. So, the solution to these complicated matters can be solved if the weaker parties use the context most favorable to them to win over the issue. Meaning that weaker states could manipulate and negotiate with the intergovernmental organization handling the matter, in order to gain concessions out of the conflict, without having to bear with many collateral damages the other parties might cause. 

# Boundaries in Bargaining

We must first understand the boundaries in bargaining in order to define, promote and constrain the bargaining process. With the understanding of our object's limitation, it will serve as opportunity tools for effective negotiation and bargaining. Hence, the six boundaries of negotiation we will take a look at are: 

- geography — borders between states and state entities, the issue of sovereignty
- system — the strength of states and international organizations
- needs — the role of interests and positions
- resources — the capacity of people and their tools
- regulators — the significance of rules and negotiations, norms and values
- time — short-term versus long-term perspectives and projections

## GEOGRAPHY: BARGAINING BORDERS

Geographical borders were negotiated in the two classical ways to solve a bargaining problem: compromise, or compensation

Compromise is in the sense of a negotiation focusing on the sovereignty borders, and the autonomy of the people within the delimitations of their territory. However, bargaining across borders can be extremely tough since the negotiator isn't the internal actor of the affairs. 

In the past, there are things called "micro-border-bargaining" — referring to the diplomats when focusing on the border and bargained to change its course. Whereas, the concept of "macro-border-bargaining" refers to the swap of whole territories and people from one ruler to another. This solution of land trade-offs can be seen to be practical before world war 2, however, it is said to have a limited range of options available to diplomats, ergo, leading to the loss of tendency to negotiate and bargain. 

But according to Spector and Zartman, regime-building is to a large extent the answer to enhanced control in bargaining across geographic borders. Which instead of boundary swapping, they can instead compensate for their loss. This solution can be seen as a hallmark of multilateralism, where the author believes that geographic and boundary problems in bargaining might thereby wither away in a long run. 

However, the other impact that geographic and sovereignty borders brought on the negotiation process is mandating diplomats. Ambassadors were instructed by the sovereign to negotiate on the external dimension. But oftentimes, mandates remain unclear since the actors involved are mingling in the process and the spheres of national and international are merging. Therefore, as a result of this unclear mandate, it will be stifling effect on negotiation navigation that would turn negotiator and bargaining tool to become less effective, and the inability to be creative in the process.
