# Shifts in Multilateralism â†’ Conclusion

# **Systems as Boundaries in Bargaining Processes**

The structure and dependencies of the international system create obstacles and

opportunities in bargaining across borders. Intergovernmental and non-governmental

organizations, states as well as regions, political parties and private sector companies will limit and enhance the opportunity for successful negotiation processes.

Of course, if the international organization is weak, it will be less successful than if it carries supranational authority. In other words, the more interdependency between states, the more an effective negotiation process is needed, and the stronger the international fabric has to be.

Political reality, however, cannot be overlooked. Powerful countries cannot easily be

constrained within the limits of international regimes. Yet international regimes do have an important function in channelling bargaining processes in such a way that their efficiency and effectiveness will be optimized. Without these organizational boundaries, there can be no effective processes, but these limitations also, of course, might have negative effects, such as inflexibility through over-bureaucracy

# **Needs: the role of interests and positions**

Parties take positions connected to their needs. The negotiation problem is the fruit of the situation into which it has been born. Without changing that context, the problem cannot be solved through bargaining, as it will always pop up again until external incentives change its environment.

Experience in training diplomats and civil servants, suggest that the perception of negotiating parties on process, procedures, positions, power and products (in the sense of agreements) is indeed important. Perception determines reality. In some cultures, perceptions are important but are open to nuance and change, for example through neutral media. In others, perceptions are inflexible and static. People might be used to haggling and therefore would not hesitate to use distributive bargaining (and indeed may actually enjoy it), while others are accustomed to fixed prices and do not like the risk of the give and take. It should be noted here, however, that flexibility in market haggling does not necessarily mean having an open mind-set on negotiation processes between states. To the contrary, the reverse situation has been observed: the majority of young diplomats from â€˜haggling culturesâ€™ have a tendency to be very positional/inflexible in inter-state bargaining. Those from cultures where horsetrading is not part of day-to-day life, and where approaches to negotiation are more rational and less emotional, will be inclined to be more relaxed in inter-state processes.

Some cultures see concessions as tools that can be used to bridge the gap between

positions and to move in the direction of uncovering the real needs, thereby finding

synergy between the parties â€“ and if needs be, to create synergy and Zones of Possible Agreements between the actors through trade-offs. In other cultures, however, a concession might be seen as a pure loss, even if this could be more than compensated for by certain gains.

A multi-issue process might be needed, and perhaps a multi-party interaction as well. Both complexity and opportunities will be created on purpose, throwing in new obstacles and new solutions. If bargaining is anything, it is a paradox. Solutions create problems and problems open windows for outcomes, depending on the linkages between those problems and the relationships between the parties struggling with their common and opposing interests.In general, longer processes will be needed to overcome complex situations. Interests will have to be reframed, and negotiatorsâ€™ mind-sets will have to be turned over. This takes energy, time, and also resources to deal with the bargaining barriers in an effective way.

# **Resources: Human, Immaterial and Material**

Power and influence create boundaries for the weak and remove them for the strong. Yet power and influence are not only structural, but also situational. The question is not only what the resources are, where they are and who is controlling them, but also how they are dealt with in the process needed to go from A to B, and how they are influenced by that process.

Humans, then, pose boundaries and create opportunities. Character, culture, expertise, profession, skill, style and non-verbal leaks all contribute to a positive or negative flow of the process. The question of the ideal effective negotiator is an old problem, but some authors have found some reasonable answers.For example, effective negotiators are those who are tough in defending their interests, while being flexible in the process. They use power without overdoing it, working on the relationship with the other side without coming too close, thus avoiding emotional blackmail. For example, parents have all the material resources that children lack, but the children are often the more successful negotiators, using the emotional means at their disposal. In relationship-dominated bargaining, this will indeed give the emotionally skilled negotiator power. In a business-like, more rationalistic process, the relationship will be of less importance. Rationale and emotions will either create boundaries or remove them, depending on people, the context and their interdependencies.

Immaterial resources were partly dealt with in the paragraph above, but these

resources are not always tied to individuals. They can also be an integral part of history or culture, such as moral obligations, past suffering, or cultures of blaming and shaming. These all bring emotional boundaries into play. If the Germans had not accepted their wrongdoings in the Second World War, the European Union could not have been so successful. In other words, boundaries to the convergence of material resources could only be removed by conceding on the emotional dimension.

Material resources will, in general, be a more decisive boundary for the less-powerful

than immaterial resources.A special kind of material resources are natural resources like gas, oil, iron, gold, and to a certain extent food and wood. Their ever-growing scarcity will give rise to a multitude of bilateral and multilateral negotiation processes of a predominantly distributive nature. As availability of these commodities diminishes, the bargaining processes will multiply and polarize. The nature of these processes will not be limited to international bargaining, but will be characterized as much by trade-offs and compromises between regions within countries. This in turn can set internal strife into motion, enhancing the two-level dimension of bargaining across borders, and adding to its complexity. This will place serious strain on regional and global negotiation systems, to the extent that new, innovative forms of bargaining will have to be developed.

# **Regulators: Law, Procedures, and Diplomatic Norms and Values**

Rules and regulations can also be both obstacles and facilitators of effective bargaining. Those who are weak need protection through international law, while to the strong, the law might be an obstacle.

Procedures are important boundaries in inter-state bargaining, regulating the

behaviour of the parties in such a way that the processes might be successful. In that sense, procedures are boundaries creating channels for effective processes, although they will also hamper those parties who want to exceed these delimitations for situational purposes. It is very much up to chairpersons, secretariats, facilitators, mediators and negotiators to deal with procedures in such a way that they will not be a negative bureaucratic obstacle, but can be manipulated in favour of a successful outcome. Stop-the-clock tactics used by negotiators in the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) â€“ renamed the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 1994 â€“ are an example of mollifying the procedures in order to temper the negative effects of their inflexibility. While the CSCE had to finish work on the Helsinki Final Act on 1 August 1975, the clock was stopped in order to allow for extra hours of negotiation.

Diplomatic norms and values regulate negotiation behaviour in order to overcome

cultural and other differences and to create opportunities for effective flow. Yet outsiders might see them as barriers to effective participation in the process, as not being acquainted with these prerequisites, they could feel excluded and discriminated against.

# Shift in Multilateralism

It can be said that powerful states can grow to where involvements in institutions and multilateralism could be harmful to their effectiveness. It means that a state powerful enough, might taken unilateral and bilateral actions instead of multilateral. As an example, during the Bush administration, the US mostly used unilateral solutions rather than multilateral frameworks to pursue its interests. These cases includes, the US using 'national security' risks to perform military interventions without mandates from the UNSC. The withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. The refusal to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. and more.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Cases of US picking unilateral over multilateral solutions:

- Use 'national security' as justification for military intervention
- Withdrawal of Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
- Refusal to ratify Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty
- Refusal to accede creation of International Criminal Court
- Neutralizing multilateral TWO agreements for bilateral instead
</aside>

During the Obama administration though, they changed and recognized the consequences of dismantling the multilateral order. As setting the norm of actions unilaterally could cause collateral damage for national interests in the long run. 

We live in a world of increasing mutual dependency, with a natural tendency in the direction of regime-building in order to reach more predictable negotiation results. If negotiation processes are embedded in strong and stable international structure, it will make guaranteed outcomes possible.

However, there are challenges in regime-building that we must cope with.

# Coping With Challenges

We can observe that new international orders and regimes come into being mostly after man-made disasters. That means states need to see the cost, before they're willing to pay the price. For example, World War 1 created the League of Nations, only for World War 2 to create United Nations after it. The Cold War created NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Then the 3 times German-French Wars created the European Union. 

Even with the costly man-made disasters, it still requires strict conditions for a regime to be born. 

- It is that only if the threatened states cannot deal with the threat on its own and need allies
    - If the threatend state is very strong, having a regime would hamper its capabilities instead
- Another condition is that only if Ad-Hoc coalitions, created just to address this one problem, cannot help, and a institutionalized structure is need that they are made

Therefore there is a dilemma, where creating a new institution means creating a bargaining platform for states, but at the same time it would restrict the bargaining range and freedom of more powerful states, making them less likely to participate, which is bad for everyone. 

However, sometimes these new challenges could revive existing organizations that were never really used or lost its usefulness. Such in the cases of the African Union to address the need for peacekeeping in Africa. And the Need for security, stability, protection of human rights that revived the CSCE and the OSCE.

# Possible Future Development

So what's possible for the future development of regime building? A regime is only one part of international order. It requires an equilibrium or a peace maintaining instrument or structure for regimes to mature and flourish over time. And this can take the first half of the 21st century. In the past, these had been Mutually Assured Destruction, risk management systems, the Concert of Europe, or a balance of interests.

ðŸ’¡ Past Peace Maintaining Instruments

- Mutually Assured Destruction
- Risk Management Systems
- Concert of Europe
- balance of interests
</aside>

Regimes, being about multilateral relations, doesn't mean it doesn't need lesser structured modes of cooperation. For regimes to strengthen, states will still need to use ad-hoc negotiation processes and bilateral bargaining.

And there are other problems to look out for such as

Level of negotiation where some governments in the European Union push their national problems to the EU to handle and blame them for not being effective

And also Inclusiveness is also important as inclusiveness can bring both opportunities but also problems and exclusions even more so.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ So in conclusion the main takeaways from this Chapter about Processes and Context are

- bargaining *with* boundaries is a viable alternative to warfare and other tools of conflict management,
- However boundaries could pose problems to effective cooperation that we have to undo.
- Regimes build networks to deal with negative aspects of boundaries
- Context and processes affect and shape each other in the long run.
