# Shifts in Multilateralism

- How would the US be too big for multilateral negotiation regimes?
- During the Bush admin, the US was so big it used unilateral actions to expand its influence
    - through unilateral solutions rather than mutlilateral frameworks in pursuing US's interest
    
    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡ Cases of US picking unilateral over multilateral solutions:
    
    - The Bush administrationâ€™s willingness for military intervention when US national security was supposed to be at stake, without even a mandate from the UN Security Council
    - the sudden withdrawal of all support for the implementation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty
    - the US Senateâ€™s refusal to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)
    - the US refusal to accede to the Statute of Rome on the creation of the International Criminal Court
    - the neutralizationÂ â€“Â for example through the North American FreeTrade Association (NAFTA) â€“ of multilateral WTO agreements by â€˜voluntaryâ€™ bilateral covenants with trading partners
    </aside>
    
- Is mutilateral negotiation regimes becoming obsolete because US won't use them anymore?
- What are the consequences of US only using unilateral approaches?
- Obama administration changed and recognized the consequences of dismantling the multilateral order (unilateral actions)
    - Collateral damage of one-sided actions can be bad for national interests in the long run
    - a [[Structural Realism\|Structural Realism]] strategic perception: what is the specific concept its referring to?
- we live in a world of increasing mutual dependency, with a natural tendency in the direction of regime-building in order to reach more predictable negotiation results
    - if negotiation processes are embeded in strong and stable international structure, it will make gauranteed outcomes possible.

# Coping With Challenges

- New international orders come into being after man-made disasters
    - [[World War 1\|World War 1]] created the [[League of Nations\|League of Nations]]
    - [[World War 2\|World War 2]] created the [[United Nations\|United Nations]]
    - [[Cold War\|Cold War]] created [[NATO\|NATO]] and the Warsaw Pact
    - 3 German-French Wars created the [[European Union\|European Union]]
- Regimes are created after major threats arises but only under strict conditions
    - But only if the threatened can't deal with it on its own and need allies
        - If a strong state is threatened, a regime would hamper its capabilities
    - Also only if Ad-Hoc coalitions can't be used and institutionalized structure is needed
- New challenges can revive existing organizations that wasn't used or lost its usefulness
    - Need for peacekeeping in Africa revived The Organization of African Unity, now African Union
    - The need for security, stability, protection of human rights and the emergence of new democratic systems revived the CSCE into the OSCE
- Dilemma of new institutions
    - it creates a bargaining platform, but at the same time it restricts the bargaining range and freedom of the more powerful states
        - Powerful states would rather not be in an institution and form unilateral, bilateral, or trilateral arrangements instead
        - Sometimes states need institutions, but sometimes they choose not to
            - That can be disasterous for the common good of everyone in the institution

# Possible Future Development

- Evolution of regimes could be observed through the increasing cost of violence and the increase of international organization and cooperation
- In the 21st century
    - a equilibrium or peace maintaining instrument is needed for a regime to mature and flourish
        - similar to the past of Mutually assured destruction, risk management, Concert of Europe, or a balance of interest
    - and this can take the first half of the 21st century
    - regimes can only strengthen if states also prioritize less-structured modes of cooperation such as
        - ad-hoc negotiation processes
        - bilateral bargaining because multilateralism doesn't work without bilateralism
            
            > "As negotiations are the life-blood of regimes, so bilateral  negotiation is the gist and juice in creating a new balance of power among the major  regimes, whether they are states or international organizations"
            > 
- Level of negotiation is another problem
    - Some governments in the European Union push their national problems to the EU to handle and blame them for not being effective
- Inclusiveness is also important as inclusiveness can bring both opportunities but also problems and exclusions even more so.

# Conclusion

Main takeaways

- bargaining *with* boundaries is a viable alternative to warfare and other tools of conflict management,
- However boundaries could pose problems to effective cooperation that we have to undo. These problems are
    - Geographic boundaries
    - Systemic exclusion
    - Unwillingness to negotiate
    - Regulations obstructing creativity
    - Time Management
- Regimes build networks to deal with negative aspects of boundaries
- Context and processes affect and shape each other in the long run.
