# IS404 Video Project Research

# Theoretical Analysis

- Why the US and USSR failed to control Afghanistan?
    - [[Theoretical Perspectives on Game Theory\|Theoretical Perspectives on Game Theory]] of [[Strategic Realism\|Strategic Realism]]: finite player (US) vs Infinite player (Taliban) [^1]
        - Taliban were fighting for survival
        - While US was fighting for pride, proving it did not fail a 20 year war, less committed, without end goal in mind

# Apply theories from lessons in the case: why actors do certain things (Resan)

- What Taliban wants in the short term:
    - recognition of legitimacy as real government
        - It had diplomatic missions years before the 2021 takeover to not return to itâ€™s state of rule in the 1990s [^6]
        - Says they will amend their press freedom, womenâ€™s rights and a general amnesty. [^6]
            - But on ground actions from journalists & analysts says nothing has changed
    - lift of sanction & freezing of assets
    - full control of Afghanistan without external interference
    - Taliban was in negotiation with the US and international community and is amending its image to fit better [^7]
        - ISIS is opposite it, so what is itâ€™s strategy exactly? is Talibanâ€™s position changable?
- What Taliban wants in the long term
    - spread of Sharia law all over the world (incompatible & cannot co-exist with the worldâ€™s ideology)
    - Taliban, Islamic State in Syria & Iraq are hostile to US, and US is regarded as a principle obstacle to establishing Sharia rule across the world through conquest [^4]
- dealing with **extremist terrorist** groups such as al-Â­Qaeda: [^3]
    - Doesn't have motivation of obtaining specific, tangible, negotiable objectives, how are they extremist?
        - They can be explained using [[Identity\|Identity]]â€™s Social Catagorization [^5]
            - Taliban catagorize their enemies with the inadoption of their religion and Sharia law (In-group > Out-group)
        - Morale can be enhanced by unquestionable loyalty to group, cause, and willing to the call for sacrifice (similar to nationalism [^5]
    - But now the Taliban is the only influential power in Afghanistan
        - Conflict Management Strategy of **Standing Firm**: to signal the commitment to block an excessive and unreasonable demand. (Against extremist groups...) [^2]
            - Taliban has stood firm and US also stood firm: 1992 Taliban rule, it projected incompatible goals that cannot co-exist with the international community
            - Taliban is making an effort to project its less-extremist ideology to the international community to gain recognition of legitimacy.
        - They have more bargaining power and leverage now without outside interference
    - But want broad, ideological doctrines which seek the total destruction of an enemy society in long term
        - Taliban cannot put their restless commanders and fighters, who only knew a life of continuous violence and fighting [^4]
            - Fighters cannot be made into quiet, peaceful citizens
    
    ðŸ’¡ This was what Talibanâ€™s rule in 1992 was. Extremist, isolating, incompatible goals, a threat to the international community.
    
- Taliban now have short term interests: relieving sanctions, unfreezing assets
    - Now they must negotiate, give concessions (less strict on women's rights and press)
    - Leverage: most countries will only lift sanctions if clear and transparent actions are taken for human rights...
    - Negotiation happens when both parties wants to change the status quo
        - International community wants progress in womens rights and free press
        - Taliban wants access to its assets and free flow market
        - Some parties does not want any involvement with the Taliban at all due to their values being so polarizing such as Italy and France [^6]
- Failed state or no?
- What comes nexts for international community and US, to transform conflict in Afghanistan.
