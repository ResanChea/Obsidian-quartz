# Questions Notes

The trilateralism doesnt have an institution, only meet up to discuss

- very informal
- wanted to create another regional org called NAPSI (China and Japan rejected offer)

THe trilateralism doesn't discuss security issues only focus on economic issues

- Border conflicts (claim of sovereignty)

Asian Paradox

- Economically interdependent makes security unstable politically

# Asia Pacific Community Regional Organization

ASEAN + 3 to improve it's centrality

- product of 1997 financial crisis
- focus more on economic cooperation over political security
    - Financial swap

ARF confidence building measures → Preventive diplomacy → Conflict resolution

EAS balance of power in east Asia. Dealing with political issue and security dilemma

Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mainland China are separate because EAS is a economic organization not a political one. They have different economic view and size. The asian dragons should be represented separately from China as a whole.

ASEAN ADMM+ look at security issue

Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, invite scholars and ministers of defense to discuss perspectives of security → promote confidence and resolve conflicts in the region
