# Problems and Arguments

## Delayed Election Background

Current president is still in office after his term expired on Feb 2020

- Disagreement between federal & regional governments
- extended term 2 years
- condemned by western countries

Reason why it happened

- Dispute between federal government and state government (clans rebels groups)
    
    Factions disagree on how to share power
    
- Extended to Feb 2021: but parliamentary election didn't happen
    - Lead to protests â†’ Concerned the UN â†’ Extend AMISOM mandate â†’ 31st Dec 2021
- The lower house approved the extension of the presidential term, but was condemned by the AU and the EU
- Parliamentary approved extension of term without election but sparked disputes

Federal government doesn't have legitimacy (corruption, bad governance)

- State government doesn't support federal government

---

Somalia's office is currently held by a president who's term has expired and election is withheld. The  disagreement between different factions, governmental state, and the federal government has created tension that has halted governmental processes, the process of democracy, as well as violence in competition for power. For those reasons, the United States would like to propose a way for the Federal Government and federal member states to agree on a practical model for peaceful, timely, inclusive and credible elections. Furthermore, we urge the Federal Government and federal member states to agree on a practical model for peaceful, timely, inclusive and credible elections.

## Proposed Solutions

1. Urged the Federal Government and federal member states to agree on a practical model for peaceful, timely, inclusive and credible elections.
2. For the UN and its members to facilitate in organizing a special conference between the Federal and state government of Somalia for mediated dialogue in establishing a formal solution in the sharing of power in Somalia.
    - peaceful transition of government
    - Urge the Federal government to prepare consensual road map with clear timelines to ensure that elections will take place
3. For AMISOM to help ensure transparency in organizing a free and fair election alongside the government and to ensure a peaceful transition of government
    - for fair election to take place
