# Clause 7

[[Chea Resan\|Chea Resan]] US

7. Calls upon the Security Council members, international organizations, and the international community to provide military training assistance, exchanging experts and expertise in strengthening the capacity of the Somalia National force to deal with Al-Shabab on their own without the need for AMISOM’s support;

China: fully lift arm embargo

The United States of America would like to respond to the good delegate of People Republic of China. The United States believe in the purpose of the embargo over Somalia as commercial trade of weapons across Somalia borders would only cause more insecurity. Commercially available weapons would only fall into the wrong hands such as rebels and Al-Shabaab that would inevidably cause more chaos than good in Somali society and cause harm to civilian, which further deteriorating humanitarian situation in Somalia.

1. The United States of America would like to respond to the good delegate of People Republic of China. The United States strongly believe that the partial lifting of arm embargo should be renewed as tradition. The argument raised by the good delegate of China to fully lift the arm embargo over Somalia would not allow much more of progress to happen, because as of 2006, the UN resolution for that year had partially lift of arm embargo in Somalia already, which allows for trade of weapons for the purpose of peacekeeping, Somali capacity building, and intervention missions. The complete lift of arm embargo would only cause weapons to fall into the hands such as Al-Shabaab, rebels, and civilians which will cause more chaos than good. So we the USA would like for all delegates to reconsider both the positive and negatives from this embargo lifting.
    
    In February 2007 Security Council Resolution 1744 limited the embargo to non-state actors. It allowed the supply of weapons and military equipment intended solely for the purpose of helping develop Somali security sector institutions if the sanctions committee on Somalia had been notified in advance and on a case by case basis and if the SC had not made a negative decision within five working days after the notification.
    
2. provide more focus on training Somalian forces to have the capability of defending itself, but we don't want to get rid of AMISOM rn

India: UNSC provide military training to Somalia

Vote

expertise in strengthening the capacity of the Somalia National force to deal with Al-Shabab without the reliance fully on AMISOM;

- To fulfil the first objective of AMISOM in handing over security responsibilities to SCF

# Clause 8

8. Calls for the federal government and federal member states to work together towards an agreement for peaceful, timely, inclusive, and credible one-person-one-vote elections;

China: Calls for all relevant parties in Somalia to further finding the political settlements with the support of the AMISOM for peace and stability in Somalia, and the interest of the Somali people.

Merge

- Calls for the federal government and federal member states to work together with the support of AMISOM to find peace, stability, and for reinstatement of a legitimate government in the near future.

# Clause 9

[[Hout Mengthu\|Hout Mengthu]] Kenya

- too early to talk about preparation before and after election
    - but this is just a fall back for in case an agreement of an election take place

# Clause 10

Recommends the ~~United Nations and its members~~  AMISOM to organize a peaceful special meeting to create dialogue among the federal governments and prepare a consensual road map with clear timelines for a peaceful, timely, inclusive, and credible election;

China and India: Too broad: should call upon dialogue between parties with AU assistance, Somalia-led Somalia-owned dialogue

- No intervention, sovereingty

Argument:

- Third party would encourage conflicting parties to participate in the dialogue
- Somalia hosted dialogue or conference would make state members to not want to join due to biasedness

The United States of America would like to clarify once again that the involvement of AMISOM in organizing a formal dialogue would not unconsentually force plan of election to be accepted without proper talks and agreements first. Furthermore, seeing as the AMISOM as a politically unbiased party, the conflicting parties will have more incentive to join dialogue rather than passing a federally arranged meeting as biased and unproductive. 

In this case, The United States of America believes that calling for internal dialogue would still only have one end objective, which is reinstating democratic practices in Somalia. Therefore, the United States of America retain our support over clause 7 through 11 in case of an agreement is of no harm if not necessary in the future.

# Clause 11

[[Sokha Nylyching\|Sokha Nylyching]] Niger

Strongly encourages, In the condition that an agreement for an election to take place in Somalia,  the UNSC to offer to implement and oversee the internal governance for hosting a transparent, free, and fair election to ensure a peaceful transition of government by the end of 2021;

- if extend the 2021 to any later year, the extension of the government rn would still be the problem.
- It doesn't push any immediate actions the UN wants
- Might compromise to amend to less demanding wordings

The United States of America believes there is no concern of overstepping sovereignty, the United Nations would only be able to take actions if proper permission and acceptance is given by the concerning state. Therefore, the this clause, if passed, would only be an offer of an unbiased party to provide guidance.

The ultimate goal of the UN is to put in place a legitimately chosen leader and to continue the system that was already in place in Somalia before the inciting incident , to have a stabilized leadership capable of dealing with security and humanitarian issues plaguing the country. 

The proposals would also help in giving trust to both the federal government and federal member states of the United Nations support over their election process to ensure transparency and unbiasedness.

# Reference

The resolution maintains the existing embargo but states that its provisions do not apply to transfers of military equipment, technical training and assistance intended for the regional intervention force. [(SIPRI)](https://www.sipri.org/databases/embargoes/un_arms_embargoes/somalia)

Until Nov. 15, 2020, the arms embargo on Somalia shall not apply to deliveries of weapons and military equipment "intended solely for the development of the Somali National Security Forces or Somalia security sector institutions," the resolution said.

Embargo in place Since 1992

In December 2006 Security Council Resolution 1725 partially lifted the UN arms embargo on Somalia. The resolution authorized the Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD) and African Union member States to deploy a regional intervention force to protect Somalia's Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and to arm and train the TFG security forces. The resolution maintains the existing embargo but states that its provisions do not apply to transfers of military equipment, technical training and assistance intended for the regional intervention force.

In February 2007 Security Council Resolution 1744 limited the embargo to non-state actors. It allowed the supply of weapons and military equipment intended solely for the purpose of helping develop Somali security sector institutions if the sanctions committee on Somalia had been notified in advance and on a case by case basis and if the SC had not made a negative decision within five working days after the notification.

On 12 November (2020?), the Security Council adopted resolution 2551 renewing the partial lifting of the arms embargo on Somali security forces, the authorisation for maritime interdiction to enforce the embargo on illicit arms imports and charcoal exports, and humanitarian exemptions to the regime. The resolution also renewed the mandate of the Somalia Panel of Experts until 15 December 2021. The resolution received 13 votes in favour and two abstentions (China and Russia).

## Election Issues

The agreement known as the “September 17 agreement” called for the election of federal lawmakers through indirect elections.

The extension of the presidential term on 12 April 2020 triggered the fury of the opposition, to the point of degenerating into armed clashes last Sunday in Mogadishu, between government forces and pro-opposition, leaving three dead.

May 2 year extension is cancelled

Dialogue is being taken place

Dialogue supported by AMISOM

- UN is interventionist role, is not ASEAN
