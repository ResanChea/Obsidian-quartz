# Summary/Script

# 1. Case Study: Somalia

1991 there was a break out in civil war that caused famine and starvation in Somalia UNSG put out US-led UNITAF forces.

It succeeded in aid and cease-fire in areas of deployment but failed to make peace

In 1993, it was replaced by UNOSOM II with 20,000 troops 6,000 less than UNITAF. After 23 of their soldiers were killed, UNOSOM II targeted General Aidid (the leader) switching from peacekeeper to a conflicting party.

US's degrading relations with UN also impacted it. In 1994, the US halted troops from Haiti democratic government restoration. The US blocked UNSC response to Rwanda genocide and refuse to call it a genocide. The US also participated less in UN peacekeeping operations. It led to the end of UNOSOM II in 1995 because US was 5,000/20,000 of its troops.

Attempts of a transition of government since the 2000s failed and led to another large famine in 2008.

This was an example of a UN failed peacekeeping mission.

# 2. War as origin of security governance

20th century was the most destructive but it was the building peace in preventing wars (creation of IGOs & int' laws)

## 2.1. The nature of war has changed

Over the past 60 years, there has been less interstate war but more intrastate conflicts, but over all the number of active conflicts are down. Hewitt argues that we are better at solving long-standing conflicts because new conflicts is at the same rate over the last 60 years. As wars brings many humanitarian disasters, the world has been shifting from the Westphalian's focus on state security to protection of humans. 

## 2.2. IGO and Security

Origin of IGO to promote security

- First emerged early 20th century during WW1 and WW2
- Regional Security Organizations appeared after Cold War

LoN and UN believes in a permanent IO

- with peace-loving states as members
- Could prevent future wars

And they created their Charters to achieve those goals.

Regional security arrangements appeared during Cold War

- Traditional Alliances: mutual aid during attack
- Collective Defense Organization: NATO more commitment

ASEAN: different approach

- Confidence building
- Conflict prevention before conflicts even happen

---

Now only UNSC has the authority to authorize use of force and make member states undertake sanctions and enforcement actions.

Since the 1990s there is more and more cooperation and division of labor between UN and RGO in humanitarian actions

## 2.3. NGO and Security

NGOs impact security through

- think tanks: research to understand and advise to maintain a stable peace
- International Crisis Group: is an nongovernmental organization that is considered a major source of analysis and advice
    - Crisis alerts: in advising peace negotiations
    - offering new strategic thinking to states on conflicts that can be prevented
- NGOs focusing on arms control and disarmament issues
    - Greenpeace
- Humanitarian relief operations

## 2.4. Norms related to the use of force

LoN didn't prohibit use of force for dispute settlements

UN's Charter

- all Members settle disputes by peaceful mean
    - Only exception for the use of force in self-defense/self-determination

### Promoting Human Security and Humanitarianism

The Geneva Conventions was the core of international humanitarian law

- protect civilians
- prisoners of war
- wounded soldiers
- legal base for war crimes

NGOs pressured UN&IGOs about human security

â†’ The Genocide Convention: UN able to use force to prevent suppress crimes against humanity

The norm of human security over state security eventually led to states having the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) its people from human security issues.

## 2.5 International theories and security governance

Realism

- 'hard' variety: says that states are more likely to use force to create a balance of power and only superpowers are able to intervene in security concerns, but they usually don't have the incentive to do so.
- The 'soft' variety: mentions more and broader types of actors in negotiation for peace. Diplomacy and mediation can change the cost-benefit analysis of states to deter war.

Liberals see NGOs, IGOs, individuals, states, groups may play third party role in settling disputes peacefully

- Liberals use Liberal Cooperation theory to form contents of agreement for durability of peace
- Liberals use the democratic peace theory to build long lasting peace

Constructivism explains how norms of the use of force has changed through history and which groups' security should be protected over one another

# 3. Mechanisms for peaceful settlement of disputes

- The Hague Conventions gave war preventing mechanisms
    - Good Office
    - Inquiry
    - Mediation
    - Conciliation
    - Adjudication
    - Arbitration

## 3.1. Preventive Diplomacy

is to change thinking of parties about purpose of political violence and deter escalation of conflict.

It's more successful only in low violence conflicts though

- UNSC intelligence gather for early warning system
- International Crisis Group as mentioned before

## 3.2. Mediation

is a negotiation where a third party help conflicting parties see the cost of continuing violence is more than the benefits.

Mediators come from powerful states, middle states, or IGOS&NGOs

- Without official power: help bring parties to meet
- With power: could halt fighting and provide incentive and assurance for going through with a formal settlement

## 3.3. Arbitration

Parties consent to refer dispute to impartial third-party tribunal court for a binding decision from international law rather than through the diplomatic process.

Arbitration panel consist of

- 1 neutral individual: UNSC
- Optional: 2 chosen in agreement by both parties

## 3.4. Adjudication

Parties refer dispute to international courts that already exist and paid by the international community

---

Either Arbitration or Adjudication is used for dispute settlement is decided in the bilateral treaty between the two conflicting parties.
