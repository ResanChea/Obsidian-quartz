IGO & NGO create norms, institutions, mechanism, and activities to push that certain rights are universal

Human rights NGOs and individuals persuaded governments to adopt human rights norms

1. Set human rights standards and norms: separate 'right' and 'wrong' for enforcement. 
    - Through treatymaking

Women, children, minorities, rights to education, social ranking, treatment might be different for different cultures, making the 

States will have sovereignty whether to allow IGOs and NGOs intervention in their cultural practice.

6. What is universalism and cultural relativism arguments on human rights?

Universalism: there are no difference in definition of human rights from different religions and cultures

However, "detailed and credible knowledge of local culture is essential for effective promotion and protection of human rights in any society"

Cultural Relativism: human rights varies according to traditional practices, values, and historical background.

You cannot use western definition of human rights or liberal systems to apply to other culturally different states
