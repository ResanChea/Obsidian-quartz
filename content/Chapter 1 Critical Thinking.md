Preconception: generally accepted concepts that changes relative to different context

# 1. Critical Thinking Standards

## 1.1 Clarity

People fail to express themselves clearly. Critical thinkers not only strive for clarity of language but also seek maximum clarity of thought.

## 1.2 Precision

precise answers to precise questions allows for clearer understanding of arguments or counter arguments

## 1.3 Accuracy

Ex: American's repeated failures in the Vietnam war was due to actions from inaccurate information

## 1.4 Relevance

staying focused on relevant ideas and information, bringing up related evidence for your arguments

## 1.5. Consistency

- Logical Inconsistency: saying/believing things that contradict one another.
- Practical Inconsistency: saying one thing and doing another, contradicting yourself.

## 1.6 Logical Correctness

draw well-founded conclusions from the beliefs we hold. Beliefs can't contridict one another.

## 1.7 Completeness

Deep and complete thinking will help make your conclusion more accurate. Indept analysis is better than shallow ideas.

# 3. Barriers to Critical Thinking

## 3.1 Egocentrism

Thinking yourself is better/superiors than everyone else

> Your opinion/actions are always right
Other's opinion/actions are always wrong
> 

### a. **Self-interested Thinking**

tendency to believe something is good/better because it benefits themselves

Critical Thinking demands that we weigh evidence and arguments objectively and impartially. Ultimately, it demands that we *revere truth—even when it hurts*.

### b. Self-serving Bias

The average people overate themselves. 

Personal Growth can only happen by knowing your weakness and where you are lacking.

## 3.2 Sociocentrism


💡 is group centered thinking reduces critical thinking to conform with everybody



### Group Bias

Belief their group(nation, tribe, neighborbood) is better than other's

### Conformism

The tendency to go with the crown from the desire to belong

Agreeing to something because many believe so.

## 3.3 Unwarranted Assumption and Stereotypes

**Assumption** belief in something without proof or conclusive evidence due to past or trustworthy source

**Unwarranted Assumption** belief in something without being reasonable by generalizing things from few cases.

## 3.4 Relativistic Thinking

### Relativism

> Truth is a matter of opinion
> 
1. **Subjectivism**: truth for a person is a matter of individual opinion
2. **Cultural Relativism**: truth is a matter of social or cultural opinion or is a social construct
3. **Moral Relativism**

- Moral Subjectivism: what is morally right and good for an individual is what they believe to be right and good

- Cultural Moral Relativism: what is morally right and good is according to their society or culture believes is morally right and good

### Problems of Relativism

- Other's horrible customs and traditions cannot be judged by a relativist (Child sacrifice, slavery)
- We cannot criticize our own societies, minority opinion opposite of the society will be wrong
- Relativist doesn't recognize moral progress, as good and bad is relative ⇒ the shift in values is just change
- Relativism leads to conflicting moral duties
    - You believe in opposition to your societal belief
    - If you belong to two or more culture that conflicts one another in beliefs

## 3.5 Wishful Thinking

> I wish * were true. Therefore, * is true.
>
