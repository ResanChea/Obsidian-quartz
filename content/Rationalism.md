In [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy), **rationalism** is the [epistemological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology) view that "regards [reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason) as the chief source and test of knowledge"[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism#cite_note-Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica:_Rationalism-1) or "any view appealing to reason as a source of knowledge or justification".[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism#cite_note-Lacey_286-2) More formally, rationalism is defined as a [methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology) or a [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory) "in which the criterion of the truth is not sensory but intellectual and [deductive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive)".
