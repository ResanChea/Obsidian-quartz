Checks if [[Independent Variable\|Independent Variable]]  (s) affect [[Dependent Variable\|Dependent Variable]] 

- $R^2$ (0-1) the % that the IV(s) account for the changes in the DV >0.5
- Significance (Sig.) must be <0.05 to be statistically significant
- Coefficient: the percentage of each the independent variables is responsible for changes in the dependent variable
- Standard Error: amount by which the coefficient varies across different cases
- t-value of the test and its value: is equal to the coefficient divided by the standard error.
