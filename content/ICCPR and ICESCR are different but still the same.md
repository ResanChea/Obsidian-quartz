# ICCPR and ICESCR are different but still the same
- It is said that ICCPR and ICESCR are somehow different, similar, and also inter-connected. Â Explain!

The International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) are two of the three International Bills of Human Rights, the remnant being the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). The two covenants were signed on the same year in 1966. The first of the two, the ICESCR commits signatories to give rights of self-determination to non-self-governing territories as well as individuals in its population. It detailed rights to basic living such as right to health, right to education, right to earn a living, and labor rights. It provided recognition of Trade Union membership as well as the protection of intellectual property of creators of any scientific, literary, and artistic work. As for the ICCPR, it is a multilateral treaty that commits signatories to respect the civil and political rights of individuals, including the right to life, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, electoral rights and rights to due process and a fair trial. It further detailed prohibitions of slavery or torture, rights to fair trail, freedom of movement, and it protected vulnerable groups in society such as children, minorities, ethnic groups, religious groups, and linguistic minorities.

Therefore, while the ICESCR focused on the broader scope of defining self-determination for colonized states, oppressed individuals, and the rights to basic life, the ICCPR focused more at the micro level of individual in societies. It gave rights and freedom to people while protecting the vulnerable groups in society. Even though these two covenants differ in their intentions and what they cover, as mentioned, they both are two of the three International Bill of Human Rights which the world adopts. They both push the same goals of giving the liberalist ideals of rights, liberty, and freedom, while also being signed in the same year.
