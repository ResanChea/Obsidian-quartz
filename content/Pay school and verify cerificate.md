About the year 4 certificate form instruction:
There are 3 important things you need: (1) your foundation year certificate, (2) your grade 12 certificate (BacII), (3) your photo as requested in the form. 
1. You can take your foundation year certificate to be approved(?)/បញ្ជាក់ at the office downstair of RUPP Building A. If your foundation year certificate has any misinformation (wrong name, DoB,...), please have a copy of your National ID, Passport, or Birth Certificate. Make sure to go pay at room 107 RUPP Building A first before going down to the office, but if it’s to correct for certificate then go to office first, I suppose?2. Your grade 12 certificate can be a copy of the official one or the temporary one. Any of them is usable as long as it has a red on it (attached is my certificate which is an approved copy of the temporary one).3. For the photo, no instruction needed here, just follow what it says on the form.4. Once you have everything ready, please give me the form and required documents to me. I’ll collect it in early January with consideration that some of you need to change your foundation year certificate.
